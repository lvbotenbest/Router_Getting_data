He became ruler of the crusader County of Tripoli at age eighteen after an Assassin blade killed his father in 1152. Raymond spent youth as hostage at the Muslim court of Nur ad Din yet escaped in 1155 and took control of his county. He soon forged alliances with fellow crusader states and married Eschiva of Bures Princess of Galilee thereby extending influence across northern Palestine.\n\n*Early life and Acclamation* reveals how the young noble endured captivity among the Zengids yet learned diplomacy that later served him well. Upon release he faced revolt from supporters of his mother but secured loyalty through swift military action and generous land grants. His reputation for caution and learning spread quickly.\n\nBetween 1164 and 1174 Raymond acted as frequent regent of the Kingdom of Jerusalem during the minority of King Baldwin IV the leper king. He led armies against Nur ad Din and Saladin yet preferred negotiation to rash battle. Chroniclers praise his prudence yet criticize reluctance to strike decisively. He championed the king against rival barons including the aggressive Raynald of Châtillon and the powerful Courtenay clan.\n\n*Conflict with Raynald of Châtillon* intensified after Raynald seized fertile valleys and insulted Muslim caravans. Raymond argued such raids endangered the kingdom and withdrew Tripolitans from joint campaigns. The feud deepened when Raynald imprisoned Baldwin loyalists and threatened royalists lands.\n\nAfter Baldwin IV died Raymond hoped to crown his esposa Eschiva or her brother yet the High Court chose Guy of Lusignan husband of Sibylla. Bitter Raymond retired to Tiberias where he maintained cautious neutrality. When Saladin invaded in 1187 Raymond advised against marching from springs yet obeyed royal command. The resulting disaster at Hattin saw the crusader army destroyed and Jerusalem lost.\n\n*Battle of Hattin and Last Years* describes how Raymond commanded the vanguard and fought valiantly yet could not prevent encirclement. Wounded he broke through with a small band and reached Tripoli. He died soon after possibly from illness or battle injuries on September 27 1187.

I am writing to extend a formal invitation to a pivotal meeting that will shape the trajectory of our collective efforts for the remainder of the year. The meeting is designed to bring together every voice that is correlated with the success of our shared objectives so that we can align our visions and accelerate our impact.\n\nThe session will take place on Tuesday 18 July at 10:00 AM in the Redwood Conference Center on the fourth floor of our downtown headquarters. We have arranged for a light breakfast and refreshments to be served starting at 9:30 AM so that you can arrive at your own pace and still connect with fellow attendees before we begin. For those who are experiencing travel constraints we will provide a secure virtual link that offers full interaction capabilities including live polling screen sharing and breakout rooms. Please indicate your preference for in person or remote attendance by replying to this message no later than Friday 14 July so that we can finalize seating and technology requirements.\n\nDuring our time together we will focus on three primary pillars. First we will review the data trends that have emerged over the past quarter and examine how they are correlated with shifts in customer sentiment operational efficiency and market demand. Second we will explore the initiatives that each department is currently experiencing from resource challenges to breakthrough moments so that we can celebrate wins and offer cross functional support where bottlenecks exist. Third we will co create a ninety day action plan that assigns clear ownership incorporates measurable milestones and establishes a rhythm of accountability that keeps momentum alive.\n\nYou are receiving this invitation because your expertise your perspective and your day to day dedication have been identified as essential to the success of this endeavor. Whether you lead a team of five or five hundred your insights will help us weave together the narrative of where we stand and where we must head next. We have deliberately kept the guest list concise yet comprehensive so that every participant can contribute meaningfully without feeling lost in a crowd.\n\nTo maximize the value of our discussion we ask that you prepare two items in advance. The first is a one page summary of the single most exciting opportunity your area is experiencing right now along with the single most pressing obstacle. The second is a short story no more than half a page that illustrates how a recent customer interaction supplier feedback or internal process revealed a hidden correlation that surprised you. These stories will serve as conversation starters and will be compiled into a shared resource library for future reference.\n\nPlease arrive with an open mind and a willingness to engage in candid dialogue. We will use a facilitator guided format that ensures every participant has equal floor time and we will capture all ideas in real time on a shared digital whiteboard that you can access both during and after the meeting. Our goal is not to deliver a polished presentation but to leave with a living document that evolves as we test learn and adapt.\n\nIf you have any accessibility requirements dietary preferences or technology questions do not hesitate to reach out to our meeting coordinator Maya Chen at maya dot chen at company dot com or extension 48219. Maya is experiencing a high volume of requests this month yet she has committed to responding to every inquiry within one business day.\n\nFinally please calendarize the meeting now and treat your attendance as a priority investment in our collective future. We recognize that schedules are crowded and obligations are many yet the dialogue we generate on the 18th will ripple outward into every project timeline budget conversation and customer touchpoint we encounter thereafter. Your presence is not merely welcomed it is indispensable.\n\nThank you for the passion you bring to our mission every single day. I look forward to experiencing the energy of our collaborative spirit in person or on screen and to witnessing the innovative pathways that will emerge once our minds meet.\n\nWith appreciation and anticipation\n\nJordan Alvarez\nDirector of Strategic Integration\nCorporate Growth Division", "cost": 0.001607, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence", "length_constraints:number_words", "punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["correlated", "experiencing"]}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 500}, {}], "result": true}
{"id": 1072, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post with 400 or more words about the benefits of sleeping in a hammock.", "response": "Swing into Better Sleep: The Surprising Science of Hammock Nights\n\nFor most of us, hammocks conjure up vacation postcards—two palms on a Caribbean beach and a paperback flopped over our chest. But a growing stack of neuroscience and orthopedics journals suggests the postcard should carry a different caption: “Best Night’s Sleep of My Life.” From deeper slow-wave brain activity to drug-free relief for aching backs, the evidence is piling up that spending the night suspended in fabric is more than a novelty; it’s a physiological upgrade.\n\n1. The Neurochemistry of Rock-a-Bye\nIn 2011, Swiss researchers at the University of Geneva rocked 12 volunteers from side to side while they napped in custom-built beds inside an fMRI tube. The gentle sway (about 0.25 Hz) accelerated the onset of N2 sleep and doubled the density of sleep spindles—brief bursts of 12–14 Hz brainwaves that mark memory consolidation and “quiet” the cortex against outside noise. A follow-up study at the University of Lausanne replicated the effect over full nights: consistent rocking shortened the time needed to reach deep slow-wave sleep by an average of 3.2 minutes and increased overnight retention of paired-word recall tasks by 17 percent. In short, the same motion that calms a baby works on the adult limbic system, locking in what you learned yesterday while you dream tonight.\n\n2. Spinal Decompression Without the Chiropractor\nBeds sag; floors don’t give. Hammocks do both—and neither. When you hang the foot end 4–6 inches lower than the head and lie diagonally, the fabric molds to the natural S-curve of your spine, letting the intervertebral discs re-hydrate without pressure hotspots. A 2019 Mexican study of 30 chronic low-back-pain sufferers found that four weeks of nightly hammock use reduced Visual Analog Pain scores by 31 percent compared to memory-foam mattresses. Patients also showed a 12-degree average increase in lumbar flexion in the morning, the kind of looseness people usually pay $150 an hour to achieve on a Pilates reformer.\n\n3. Breath by Breath: Asthma and Snoring\nSnoring occurs when gravity collapses soft tissue against the airway. In a hammock, the torso is cradled at a slight incline, keeping the tongue and soft palate from falling backward. A 2020 Iranian paper on positional therapy recorded a 34 percent drop in apnea-hypopnea index when subjects switched from supine mattress sleeping to a 15-degree inclined hammock configuration. For asthmatics, the same gentle elevation reduces post-nasal drip and allows the diaphragm to descend more fully, cutting nighttime rescue-inhaler use in a small Brazilian trial.\n\n4. Thermoregulation 2.0\nAir circulates above and below you, dissipating the one liter of insensible water vapor you exhale and perspire every night. Result: a micro-climate that stays close to 28 °C (82 °F)—the set-point that triggers the deepest delta sleep—without the energy cost of air-conditioning. During winter, slip an under-quilt beneath the hammock and you create a toasty 2-inch pocket of warm air, no electric blanket required.\n\n5. The Psychological Dividend\nMRI data aside, most converts simply “feel” the difference. The vestibular system reads the rocking as safe, maternal, and pre-verbal; cortisol slopes downward faster than on a stationary bed. Outdoor enthusiasts often report that the gentle sway removes the subtle muscle bracing we perform against the tiny tremors of a house—traffic, refrigerator hum, a partner turning—allowing the nervous system to drop one more floor into restoration mode.\n\nMaking the Transition\nStart indoors. Use an 11-foot gathered-end parachute nylon hammock with a structural ridgeline to maintain the same 30-degree sag every night. Sleep in layers—cotton blanket inside, top-quilt on top—so you can fine-tune warmth without touching cold walls. Expect a 3–5-night learning curve while your proprioceptors recalibrate. Once you wake up without remembering how you got there, you’ll know your brain has voted.\n\nBottom Line\nA hammock is not a futon bolted to the ceiling; it’s a physics hack that turns gravity into a massage therapist, a metronome, and a sleep spindle factory all at once. You don’t have to sell your mattress—just give your physiology a four-night audition. When you discover you can remember where you left your keys, twist deeper into yoga poses, and skip the espresso, you may decide the vacation postcard is actually the way home.", "cost": 0.001966, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 400}], "result": true}

Your entire response should be in English and all lower case (no capital letters whatsoever).", "response": "the social network review\n\ndavid fincher’s 2010 film about the birth of facebook is a precision-engineered thriller disguised as a tech-startup origin story. from the first scene—an explosive two-minute breakup in a harvard bar that never raises its voice yet leaves emotional shrapnel in every corner of the frame—the movie announces its intentions: to chase the lonely hum inside the loudest innovation of the century.\n\njesse eisenberg’s mark zuckerberg is a caffeinated iteration of hal 9000: emotionally vacant, intellectually voracious, mechanically certain that every relationship is a solvable algorithm. the performance is all staccato cadences and eyes that already seem to be buffering the next sentence. he is both pathetic and terrifying, a kid who gets dumped and responds by reshaping global human interaction into something he can understand: code, shares, page views. you can’t look away, because eisenberg never begs for sympathy; instead he invites forensic fascination.\n\nthe script, aaron sorkin’s coked-up shakespearean sprint, is the film’s most divisive weapon. dialogue overlaps, ricochets, pirouettes. people talk like they’re typing at 90 words per minute. somehow it never feels fake; it feels like harvard finals week at 3 a.m. when everyone is convinced they are the smartest person in the room and the room is the entire planet. the verbal velocity makes the depositions—normally the dullest scaffolding of any legal drama—into gladiatorial arenas where words are axes.\n\ntrent reznor and atticus ross’s score is a seething undercurrent of distorted piano and minor-key synthetic heartbeats. it sounds like rage bubbling inside a server farm. the clicks and whirs become a second language: when securities are diluted, the music dilates into horror drones; when friendships collapse, you get a single reverbed keystroke echoing like a gunshot.\n\nfincher’s direction is iceberg-cold. the camera glides down dormitory hallways that look like submarine corridors; fluorescent lights hum like interrogation lamps. even the california scenes, drenched in golden-hour optimism, feel a degree too sharp, as if the sun itself is rendering people in higher definition than they can survive. every frame is color-corrected to suggest we are already inside a screen, one layer deeper than reality.\n\nthe supporting cast is flawless. andrew garfield’s eduardo saverin is the film’s bruised moral center, eyes widening as his best friend monetizes betrayal. the scene where he discovers his share dilution via a hastily slid legal folder is shot like a horror reveal: the paper is the monster jumping from the closet. justin timberlake’s sean parker is napster as gatsby, a seducer promising infinite parties while the fbi tail numbers blink on his blackberry. armaie hammer’s winklevoss twins—both of them—are cartoon aristocracy rendered human by sheer force of entitlement; they row through life with the calm assumption that history owes them royalties.\n\nthe film’s genius is that it refuses to declare anyone a saint or devil. it hands you contradictory testimonies, lets them brawl in your head, then logs out. was zuckerberg a thief, or merely the fastest implementer in a world where ideas are communal ether? did eduardo’s loyalty justify his executive seat, or was he a vestigial appendix to an organism evolving at wire speed? the screenplay never pauses to lecture; it keeps refreshing the feed.\n\ntechnically, the movie is a masterclass in digital-era formalism. kirk baxter and angus wall’s editing toggles between microsecond inserts of code compiling and languid overhead shots of rowing regattas, the old world’s last graceful exhale. the sound design folds keystrokes into drum tracks; every mouse click carries reverb, as if servers around the planet are clearing their throats to announce a new notification.\n\nyet beneath the tech porn and legal chess lies a bruise-blue examination of loneliness. zuckerberg’s final scene—refreshing an ex-girlfriend’s facebook page in a darkened conference room while the litigation buzzes next door—might be the saddest 30 seconds in 21st-century cinema. the camera holds on eisenberg’s face, the flicker of the monitor the only light source, and we realize the entire empire was built to search for one person who has already blocked him. the movie ends where it began: a boy staring at a screen, still coding apology notes the world will never see.\n\nsome critics dismissed the film as glossy fiction, pointing to disputed depositions and composite characters. they missed the point. the social network is not journalism; it is mythology for the pixel age, a greek tragedy whose chorus is typed in comment sections. it captures the moment when human relationships pivoted from coffee-shop flirts to notification pings, and it does so with the chill of someone who understands that every revolution begins as a prank and ends in a courtroom.\n\na decade on, the film feels truer than the reality it dramatized. we now live inside the infrastructure zuckerberg built, trading friendships for metrics, privacy for convenience, selfhood for brand. fincher and sorkin didn’t forecast the future; they reverse-engineered the present, compiling our anxieties into elegant executable code. watch it again tonight and notice how the twin oars slicing through the thames resemble the scrolling thumb on your phone: rhythmic, obsessive, ultimately circling back to the same spot, hoping the next stroke delivers something—connection, validation, apology—that never quite arrives.", "cost": 0.002359, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Founding war: Li Yuan, the first Tang emperor, marched out of Taiyuan in 617, answered the call to war against the crumbling Sui, and within a year turned war into peace by capturing Chang-an.  \n2. Transition war: Li Shimin, later Emperor Taizong, fought a brief but savage war of succession against his brothers at Xuanwu Gate in 626; once blood soaked the palace flagstones, he proclaimed peace, gave amnesty, and invited former foes to share the new peace at court.  \n3. Frontier war: Taizong then hurled the Tang into war on the steppe, shattered the Eastern Turks in 630, and accepted the title “Heavenly Khan,” promising peace to nomad tribes who had never known peace under Han rulers.  \n4. Korean war: in 645 he launched the first of three great campaigns of war against Goguryeo; although victory eluded him, the war taught Tang generals how to coordinate peace-keeping garrisons once the land was finally taken.  \n5. High Tang peace: under Emperors Gaozong and the lone woman sovereign Wu Zetian, the court sponsored poetry, printed the first peace-spreading calendars, and used war only as distant rumor while caravans carried silk, tea, and the idea of peace along the caravan roads to Samarkand.  \n6. Expansion war: Xuanzong’s early reign saw Tang cavalry once again ride to war, crush the Western Turks, plant peace-seeking garrisons in the Pamirs, and stretch the Grand Canal so grain could float north to feed both war horses and monks praying for peace.  \n7. An Lushan war: the general-turned-rebel An Lushan detonated the most ruinous war of the dynasty in 755; for eight years war scorched the Yellow River plain, and every village that had known peace learned to measure time by how long peace had been absent.  \n8. Post-rebel peace: when the war finally burned out in 763, Suzong and Daizong bought a fragile peace by hiring Uighur cavalry, paid them with silk, and promised eternal peace in silver-speckled treaties that every side knew were only temporary peace.  \n9. Long peace: between 766 and 820 the court rebuilt Chang-an, reopened the civil exams, and let war shrink to ballads while poets such as Bai Juyi and Du Fu sang of peace so vividly that readers along the Yangtze wept for a peace they could almost touch.  \n10. War of governors: after 820, regional warlords turned tax grain into private armies, and every mandate from Chang-an that spoke of peace arrived in provincial capitals as an invitation to more war; yet even then, Buddhist monasteries lit lamps for peace, and their bells tolled a promise that peace, like the Buddha-nature, could never truly be destroyed.  \n11. Huang Chao war: in 875 the salt-trader rebel Huang Chao led the greatest internal war the dynasty ever knew; his war hosts swallowed Chang-an, drove the emperor to Sichuan, and left the capital in such ruin that for a generation no farmer dared speak the word peace aloud.  \n12. Final peace: the last Tang monarch, Ai Di, abdicated in 907; the dynasty ended not with a cataclysmic war but with a quiet ceremony where the outgoing emperor handed the imperial seal to a war-bound successor and whispered, “May you find the peace we lost, and may war forgive us for dreaming that peace could last forever.”", "cost": 0.0016079999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "war", "frequency": 8}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "peace", "frequency": 10}], "result": true}

Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", "response": "\"By the 1890s the Austrian Empire, rebaptized in 1867 as the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, was no longer the same towering, almost mystical force it had represented for many South Slavs in the age of Vuk Karadžić or Ljudevit Gaj half a century earlier. The decades that had followed the revolutions of 1848-49 and the constitutional compromise with Hungary had, layer after layer, stripped Habsburg rule of its remaining romantic patina and exposed the naked scaffolding of a dynastic refuge in which Croats, Serbs, Slovenes, Bosnians, Vojvodina Serbs and Dalmatian islanders all discovered that they were, to borrow the vocabulary of the Croatian-Serbian Progressive Club in Zagreb, “step-children inside the same overheated house.”  \nThe sentiment of Croats toward the Monarchy was therefore fundamentally fractured along three axes that rarely aligned: loyalty to the Habsburg crown, loyalty to the Croatian state-right tradition, and loyalty to the linguistic-ethnic idea of a tri-named people (Croats-Serbs-Slovenes) stretching far beyond the borders the dynasty was willing to concede. The first axis, dynastic loyalty, still possessed real emotional capital inside the military frontier that had been reincorporated into civil Croatia, among the petite nobility of the Zagorje, and inside the Catholic clergy that had built its schools and charities on imperial subsidies. The same clergy, however, had watched the Monarchy sign away Croatian territory to Hungary in 1868, and Hungarian banus Khuen-Héderváry govern Croatia for twenty years with a rhetoric of “Magyardom is the future, Croatdom the museum.” Every tax increase that funded theatres in Budapest but not in Zagreb, every railway spur routed through Pécs instead of Osijek, every linguistic ordinance that pushed Magyar labels into Croatian village schools, generated its own private ledger of resentment. By 1895, when the Emperor Franz Joseph opened the new National Theatre in Zagreb, students orchestrated a spectacular bonfire of his ceremonial Hungarian-language flag; the police arrested Stjepan Radić, who later recalled that he felt less anger against the emperor personally than against the feeling that “our kingdom had once again been used as a pawn in a chess game played in Vienna and Budapest cafés.”  \n\nYet even that anger lived in tension with a fear among Croatian politicians that without the Habsburg military shield they would simply be swallowed by an expansionist Hungary to the north and an expansionist Serbia to the east. Ante Starčević’s early radicalism had already popularized the phrase “Croats have no friends but themselves,” but Starčević died in 1896, and his Party of Rights fragmented into pure-right, pure-unionist and pure-purist currents. The majority of Croatian sabor deputies still took the oath of loyalty every spring, then spent the remainder of the session condemning the very ministries that paid their travel stipends. The agonizing result was what historians sometimes call a “sentiment of double captivity”: captivity inside Hungary’s economic grip and captivity inside Vienna’s high-political indifference, both experienced as blows against the medieval crown of Zvonimir that symbolized Croatian sovereignty.  \n\nIn Dalmatia, annexed to Austria rather than to Hungary, the sentiment was different again. Venetian elites, long resentful that Vienna had swapped them from the collapsing Republic of St Mark to the Habsburg bureaucracy in 1814, now discovered that they were being outvoted in the provincial diet by Slavic National-Catholic clubs backed by Peasant Serbs from the interior. Their nostalgia for the Italian risorgimento meshed poorly with the Croatian National Union’s demand that Dalmatia be united with Croatia-Slavonia inside a hypothetical South-Slav province. Thus, at the very moment when Croatian nationalists in Zagreb dreamed of uniting Croatdom across the Monarchy, many Dalmatian Serbs looked to Belgrade, many Dalmatian Italians looked to Rome, and a majority of Habsburg bureaucrats looked only to the next imperial salary increment.  \n\nSerb sentiment inside the Monarchy in 1900 was simultaneously older and newer than the Croatian dilemma; older because Orthodox church networks had survived the Ottoman retreat and maintained a continuous dialogue with the Patriarchate in Vienna since the 1690 Great Migration, and newer because a Belgrade kingdom had appeared just across the Danube and was offering itself as a magnetic alternative. In the Military Frontier regions, Lika, Kordun, Banija and eastern Slavonia, the typical Habsburg Serb peasant still equated the emperor with dues that were lighter than those once exacted by the sipahis, with gendarmes who spoke German but at least were rarely also landlords, and above all with the promise that by petitioning the captaincy in Ogulin he could force the local ban to reopen a church school the Hungarian county prefect had shut. Loyalty therefore remained utilitarian, expressed in the grudging phrase “Slava Bogu i caru”—thanks be to God and the tsar-emperor.  \n\nYet utilitarian loyalty is brittle when alternative narratives become audible. From the 1880s onward Belgrade’s consuls (technically commercial agents, since Vienna did not recognize consulates inside Cisleithania) distributed textbooks and stipends to Serb gymnasia in Karlovac, Vukovar and Zemun. They carried with them the grammar of Vuk Karadžić, the songs of Njegoš, and above all the new political vocabulary of a “Serb nation” that ignored the Austrian provincial grid. In villages such as Rajino Selo, Orthodox priests began to recite from the epistle of Prince Nikola of Montenegro rather than from Vienna’s official almanac, and one could hear, for the first time in public taverns, the toasts “Živeo Srbija!” answered by German-accented “Hoch Österreich!” One Serbian teacher in Bosnia, still an occupied province, wrote home in 1899: “The people here love the Emperor because he protects them from the Turk’s tax collector, but they love the idea of Serbia because it tells them they are not mere frontier guards, but descendants of Lazar and Miloš.”  \n\nThat emotional duality—safety under Vienna, dignity under Belgrade—became more combustible after 1898, when Vienna allowed Budapest to station Magyar officials in the Serb-majorem counties of Vojvodina and, worse, confirmed that the 1868 Serb Orthodox church autonomy statute could be amended by the Hungarian parliament. Petition drives sprang up in Novi Sad, Sombor and Subotica, and they produced the first memorandum calling for a “Serb national circle” inside the Monarchy modelled on the Czech and Polish clubs. Hungarian authorities banned the petitioners, whereupon the Serbian National-Radical Party in Belgrade sent pamphlets across the border addressed “to our brothers on the other side of the Sava.” The result was a new sentiment among Habsburg Serbs best described as anticipatory betrayal: they felt that Vienna had already decided to trade their interests for Magyar parliamentary support, and they therefore began to store psychological capital in the idea of an eventual Belgrade-aligned solution.  \n\nStill, one must not over-read the power of national romanticism. In 1900 roughly two thirds of Serb males in Croatia-Slavonia were illiterate, and their wives often spoke kajkavian or čakavian dialects closer to Zagreb speech than to the ekavian of Šumadija. The material benefits of Monarchy—cheap iron ploughs from Lower Austria, salt from Sečevo, draft exemption if a man joined the border militia—remained persuasive. Two brothers from the same Slavonian house might enlist in the imperial army while the third slipped across the Sava to volunteer for the Serbian royal artillery; mother wept for all of them, but still hung an icon of the tsar-emperor next to that of Saint Sava.  \n\nWatching these contradictory vectors, the joint-ministerial bureaucracy in Vienna adopted a policy that contemporaries summarized with the cynical adage “Divide, subsidize, and hope for a long life.” State loans went to Croatian railways, but were routed through Budapest so that Zagreb would blame Khuen-Héderváry, not Vienna. Scholarships carried Serb students to Graz and Vienna medical faculties, on condition that they sign a loyalty pledge; when they returned home, they founded reading rooms that the provincial police then raided for “pan-Serb literature,” thereby legitimating further subsidies to loyalist priests. Net result: a national nurse-log of resentment kept damp enough to smoulder, never dry enough to ignite.  \n\nFrom the vantage point of the dynasty, sentiment was manageable so long as it remained segmented: Croats hostile to Hungarians but loyal to the crown; Serbs loyal to the dynasty but sympathetic to Serbia; Slovenes loyal to Austria but fearful of Italian irredentism; Bosnians grateful for conscription salaries but quietly appalled that the same emperor who built mosques also taxed hajj travel. The Monarchy could live with many small firebreaks, but it dreaded the Yugoslav fire, the day on which Croat federalists, Dalmatian autonomists and Serb nationalists would discover they shared a single grammatical future tense. That dread explains why Vienna monitored the 1894 wedding of Croatian Serb leader Svetozar Pribićević to a Croatian Catholic noblewoman as though it were a military manoeuvre, and why every pamphlet quoting “the tri-named people” fetched its author an instant charge of high treason.  \n\nIn sum, the sentiments that filled Croatian and Serbian notebooks at the close of the nineteenth century were too fragmented to be summarized as either “loyalty” or “resistance.” Croats nursed a grievance that their medieval crown had been leased out to Hungarian factors while Vienna pocketed the diplomatic insurance premium. Serbs balanced imperial gratitude for protection against a growing embarrassment that protection came at the cultural price of silence about their national name. Both peoples imagined liberation, but the imaginary compass needles pointed in different directions: Croat politicians dreamed of a renegotiated Habsburg federation that might restore their ban and sabor, while Serb villagers increasingly dreamed of a river-bank kingdom whose capital lay southeast instead of northeast. Both dreams, however, were still tethered to the same dynasty, still expressed in the same imperial schools, post offices and railway timetables. The emotional ledger therefore looked like a double-entry bookkeeping exercise: hostility on one page, dependence on the other, each entry waiting for the next geopolitical crisis to decide which column would ultimately be totaled. When that crisis arrived in 1908–14, those ledger books would finally close, and the balance, rendered in corpses and new borders, would show that sentiments accumulated in the 1890s had never been merely literary; they had been the deferred interest on an imperial loan that Europe’s most complicated dynasty could no longer afford to service.\"", "cost": 0.004671000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 800}], "result": true}

Give me advice in the style of a President of the United States and make sure it has at least 600 words.", "response": "My fellow American,\n\nYou have in your palm a coin ten years your senior and ten times your elder: the Roosevelt dime, first struck in 1946 to honor Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the thirty-second President of these United States.  \nIt weighs 2.268 grams, is 17.9 millimeters wide, and is composed of an alloy that has survived depressions, wars, moon-shots, and microchips.  \nTo the untrained eye it is small, silent, almost forgettable.  \nBut to the American eye—trained by centuries of ingenuity, sacrifice, and restless dreams—it is a seed.  \nAnd seeds, entrusted to the right hands, become forests.\n\nLet us therefore treat this dime not as the smallest denomination of our currency, but as the largest denomination of our possibility.\n\nFirst, remember whose profile gazes back at you.  \nFranklin Roosevelt did not merely guide the nation through the Great Depression; he re-imagined the relationship between citizen and government, between despair and hope.  \nWhen he declared that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,” he was not speaking from a palace balcony; he was speaking from a wheelchair, on a cold March noon, to a people who had been told their banks were empty.  \nThe dime you hold is a daily civics lesson: leadership is not the art of waiting for perfect conditions; it is the art of creating them with whatever is at hand.  \nSo begin there: let the dime remind you that history’s greatest turnarounds often start with the thinnest margins.\n\nSecond, understand the quiet power of compound interest—both financial and moral.  \nDeposit this dime in a savings account bearing a modest 3 percent interest, leave it untouched, and in a century it will have multiplied twenty-fold.  \nLeave it untouched for two centuries and it will have multiplied four-hundred-fold.  \nThe arithmetic is plain; the lesson is profound.  \nEvery good habit, every act of civic conscience, every minute you invest in your own education or your neighbor’s comfort is a deposit in the trust fund of the republic.  \nThe dime is your first deposit.  \nDo not wait for a larger denomination; the universe honors the velocity of vision more than the volume of coins.\n\nThird, deploy the dime as an instrument of democratic accompaniment.  \nSlip it into the expired parking meter of a stranger and you have purchased more than thirty minutes of curb time; you have purchased thirty minutes of someone’s peace of mind.  \nLeave it on the cafeteria table of a fifth-grader who forgot lunch money and you have funded not only a meal but a memory that may one day fund another kindness.  \nThese micro-interventions knit the invisible safety net that no statute can fully weave.  \nGovernment can legislate opportunity, but only citizens can legislate decency, one dime at a time.\n\nFourth, transform the dime into a pedagogical tool.  \nCarry it into a classroom and ask thirty students to estimate how many dimes would outweigh the Statue of Liberty.  \n(The answer, by the way, is roughly forty-five billion, but the journey to that answer will teach mass, volume, and the art of informed guessing.)  \nThen trace the dime’s origin: the nickel comes from Sudbury, the copper from Arizona, the manganese once stockpiled for wartime steel.  \nSuddenly geography, chemistry, and history converge in a ten-cent symposium.  \nIn that moment you will have proven what every great educator knows: curiosity scales faster than currency.\n\nFifth, allow the dime to sponsor your own internal infrastructure project.  \nSet it on your desk each morning as a tactile reminder of fiscal discipline.  \nAsk yourself: will tomorrow’s self thank today’s self for the decision I am about to make with this latte, this lottery ticket, this late-night click-to-purchase?  \nThe dime becomes a private comptroller, auditing the enterprise of you.  \nA nation that cannot balance small budgets will never balance large ones; a citizen who cannot master a dime will one day be mastered by a debt.  \nTeach the dime to speak, and it will lecture you daily on liberty—because nothing so corrodes freedom as the quiet slavery of compound interest working against you.\n\nSixth, honor the dime as a passport to memory.  \nIf you still have your first Roosevelt dime—perhaps pressed into your palm by a grandparent who lived through bank failures and breadlines—then you possess an heirloom more stable than any cryptocurrency.  \nTake a moment to engrave that memory: whittle the year of your first earned dollar onto a tiny paper flag and fold it around the coin.  \nYears from now, when digital ledgers have migrated to technologies we cannot pronounce, that dime will still be legible to the human hand.  \nIn an age of erasure, the tangible is revolutionary.\n\nSeventh, leverage the dime as venture capital for creativity.  \nMail it to yourself as “payment” for the short story you promise to finish this year; you are symbolically contracting with your own muse.  \nOr hammer it into a guitar pick, as did a luthier in Tennessee who discovered that the copper-nickel alloy produces a bluesy timbre unavailable from plastic.  \nThe dime becomes seed money for art, reminding us that GDP is not the only index of value; sometimes GDP stands for “Guitars, Dreams, and Poetry.”\n\nEighth, practice the diplomacy of the dime.  \nPost it across the ocean to a pen pal in Lagos or Lahore with a note that simply reads: “This is what ten cents looks like in America; show me what it can buy where you live.”  \nYou will have launched a miniature cultural exchange, cheaper than a hashtag and longer-lasting than a trending topic.  \nForeign policy is too important to be left solely to foreign ministries; sometimes it fits in a #10 envelope.\n\nNinth, donate the dime to a candidate, a cause, a collection plate—any venue where the many become one.  \nDo so publicly, so that onlookers see that giving is not contingent on the size of the wallet but the depth of conviction.  \nYour dime will join others until it becomes a dollar, the dollar a precinct flyer, the precinct flyer a margin of victory, the victory a policy, the policy a community transformed.  \nNever underestimate the political power of the decimals; they are democracy’s pixels, and from them we compose the picture of who we intend to be.\n\nTenth and finally, every so often, flip the dime.  \nNot merely to decide which movie to watch, but to recall the coin’s original sin and its ongoing redemption: the profile of Roosevelt replaced the Mercury dime, a coin that had symbolized freedom yet circulated in a nation where many Americans were still denied the vote.  \nThe flip is a daily referendum on whether we are moving heads-first toward a more perfect union or tails-back toward old exclusions.  \nLet the soft metallic ring when it lands serve as a gavel calling your conscience to order.\n\nMy friend, I have spoken of forests, classrooms, guitars, and revolutions—all originating from a coin smaller than a shirt button.  \nSome will say these are sentimental exaggerations; I say sentiment is the petri dish in which citizenship grows.  \nA nation that stops reading allegory into its pocket change will soon stop reading allegory into its Constitution.  \nSo carry this dime not in the lint-filled corner of your pocket but in the front chamber of your awareness.  \nLet it jingle against your keys like a tiny bell summoning you to greater purpose.  \nAnd whenever you are tempted to think your voice is too small, your vote too ordinary, your kindness too slight, close your fist around that dime and remember:  \nOnce, a man who could not walk taught a nation how to stand taller.  \nHis face on your coin is silent proof that the smallest among us can still cast the longest shadow.\n\nNow go forth, and spend—no, invest—your dime.  \nInvest it in thrift, in wonder, in mercy, in the conviction that the republic is never finished but always minted anew.  \nDo this, and you will discover what every President eventually learns:  \nLeadership is less the art of commanding armies than the art of hearing coins sing anthems when they strike the bottom of a tin cup held by a hopeful child.  \n\nAnd when that anthem reaches your ears, you will realize the most astonishing truth of all—that the cup, the child, the anthem, and the dime are all you.  \n\nMay God bless you, may God bless this coin, and may God bless the United States of America.", "cost": 0.003565, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}], "result": true}

{"id": 1265, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write an essay about how aluminium cans are used in food storage. Don’t forget to include the keywords waste, material and meal. Have more than 30 sentences in your response.", "response": "Aluminium cans have become one of the most familiar sights in every kitchen, picnic basket and vending machine because they solve a surprisingly long list of problems that arise once a meal leaves the factory and begins its journey toward the consumer.  The story begins with the metal itself: aluminium is the most abundant metallic material in the Earth’s crust, yet it was once considered more precious than gold because refining it was so difficult.  Today, thanks to the Hall-Héroult process, the cost has plummeted and the same material that once crowned the Washington Monument now ends up wrapped around a can of tomato soup.  That reversal of fortune is important, because it means the price of an aluminium can is low enough to be disposable, while the strength of the metal is high enough to keep a meal safe for years.  \n\nWhen food scientists speak about “shelf life,” they are really talking about a silent war against oxygen, light and microbes, all of which conspire to turn a nutritious meal into spoiled waste.  An aluminium can is essentially a miniature fortress: the metal wall is only 0.1 millimetre thick, yet it blocks oxygen and ultraviolet light completely, two of the main accelerants of decay.  Inside the can, a thin epoxy coating prevents the food from reacting with the metal, so green beans do not taste like pennies and cola does not etch the material into Swiss cheese.  The double seam at the top of the can is a marvel of mechanical engineering; it folds five layers of metal together so tightly that even anaerobic bacteria, which can survive in the vacuum of outer space, cannot sneak through.  \n\nBecause the seal is hermetic, the food inside can be sterilised at 121 °C for three minutes, a temperature high enough to kill botulism spores that would otherwise turn a convenience into a lethal dose of waste.  This means that a single aluminium can of chilli can sit in a hurricane-relief warehouse for half a decade and still provide a safe, hot meal the moment a rescue worker pulls the ring tab.  Compare that to a plastic pouch, which must be laminated from seven different polymers and still only manages a two-year shelf life before the material starts to delaminate and let oxygen in.  From a logistical standpoint, the aluminium can is unbeatable: it is stackable like bricks, so a pallet can carry 3,000 cans in the footprint of a dinner table, and the empty truck going back to the factory can carry collapsed used cans that occupy only 5 % of the volume they did when full, slashing the cost of shipping what will eventually become recycled material.  \n\nConsumers rarely think about those efficiencies, but they do notice that a can of beer chills in 18 minutes in an ice bucket while a glass bottle of the same volume needs 35 minutes to reach the same temperature.  The reason is that the thermal conductivity of aluminium is 205 W·m⁻¹·K⁻¹, roughly fifteen times higher than glass, so heat rushes out of the can faster than a child who realises the meal on the table is Brussels sprouts.  That same conductivity is exploited in reverse when a factory fills 2,000 cans per minute; the metal wall transfers heat away from the hot soup so quickly that the can can be laser-printed with a sell-by date only 90 seconds after filling, without warping the label or the material beneath it.  \n\nEnvironmental critics often point out that producing virgin aluminium is energy-intensive, and they are correct: every tonne of new metal demands 14,000 kWh of electricity, enough to run an average British home for a year and a half.  Yet the other side of the ledger shows that once the material exists, it can be recycled forever; 75 % of all aluminium ever produced is still in use, riding around in bicycle frames, aircraft wings and, yes, new cans.  In Japan, the circular economy is so efficient that a can tossed into a recycling bin today can be melted, rolled, filled with a new meal and back on a convenience-store shelf in 60 days, a transformation that feels closer to alchemy than to ordinary waste management.  Europeans, on average, use 45 cans per person per year; if every one of those were land-filled instead of recycled, the stack would tower 2,800 km high, piercing the altitude where satellites orbit and turning a resource into celestial litter.  \n\nRecycling an aluminium can saves 95 % of the energy required to make the same can from bauxite ore, a figure so dramatic that the aluminium industry likes to say it is “like switching off the power for twenty years on every tonne of metal.”  That energy saving translates directly into carbon emissions: one recycled can prevents the release of 0.29 kg of CO₂, the same amount produced by driving a compact car for 1.2 km.  Multiply that by the 180 billion cans manufactured annually, and the planetary benefit becomes a meal for the conscience as well as the body.  Because collection and re-melting are profitable—recyclers pay about €1,000 per tonne—aluminum cans are one of the few forms of household waste that actually subsidise the collection of less valuable material such as yoghurt pots and greasy pizza boxes.  \n\nDesigners keep pushing the envelope.  The original Coca-Cola can of 1960 weighed 80 g; today’s version weighs 29 g, a 64 % diet achieved by tweaking the alloys and thinning the wall so gradually that the diameter of the can has shrunk by less than the thickness of a human hair per year.  That weight loss matters: for every gram shaved off, a 40-truck fleet saves 28 tonnes of diesel per year, enough diesel to fry 1.2 million orders of fish and chips.  Meanwhile, the can’s shape has become a canvas for marketing psychology; studies show that a matte finish makes a low-sugar meal drink seem more “natural,” while a high-gloss lacquer signals indulgence, even though the material underneath is identical.  \n\nIn developing nations, the aluminium can is a quiet revolution against food loss.  In rural Kenya, milk that used to spoil within six hours in 30 °C heat now travels 400 km in cans, arriving as a safe, calcium-rich meal for urban schoolchildren.  The same logistics play out with coconut water in Brazil and lentils in India; where refrigeration is scarce, the can doubles as a miniature cold chain that fits in a bicycle basket.  Because the metal is opaque, vendors can stack cans in full sun without the nutrient degradation that light would otherwise cause, turning potential waste into commercial opportunity.  \n\nFrom a consumer-safety standpoint, the incidence of lead in aluminium cans is now vanishingly small—0.0001 ppm—thanks to alloy refinements that replaced lead-bearing solders with pure aluminium welds in the 1990s.  Compare that to some vintage ceramic bowls that leach 100 ppm of lead into an acidic tomato meal, and the can starts to feel like a health supplement.  Dent critics worry that a dent on the seam can let in botulism, but factory tests show the seal is so robust that even when a 1 kg weight is dropped on the can from two metres, the deformation occurs on the wall, not on the critical double seam, so the meal inside remains sterile.  \n\nThe economic footprint is equally impressive.  A single aluminium plant in Warrington, England, recycles used cans into new stock so efficiently that the mileage saved by not importing virgin metal from Australia is equivalent to a spacecraft flying to the moon and back 1,700 times per year.  That same plant pays local councils £50 per tonne of collected cans, money that can be reinvested into schools, turning yesterday’s waste into today’s textbooks.  Because the metal is non-ferrous, it can be separated from steel packaging scrap with an eddy-current machine the size of a garden shed, eliminating the need for expensive manual sorting and ensuring that the material loop stays closed.  \n\nLooking forward, researchers are experimenting with lighter alloys doped with scandium, a rare earth that could shave another 20 % off the can’s weight without sacrificing strength.  If successful, the annual global demand for aluminium could drop by 800,000 tonnes, freeing up enough electricity to power the city of Lisbon for a year.  Simultaneously, smart-labelling inks that change colour when the internal oxygen level rises above one part per million could warn consumers that a can has been compromised, transforming the package itself into a spoilage sensor and further reducing the likelihood of edible material being thrown away.  \n\nEven the ring pull has a story.  The old pull-tab detached completely, creating litter that slashed bicycle tyres and ended up in seabirds’ stomachs; the modern stay-on tab, mandated since 1975 in most jurisdictions, is a tiny example of how design can pre-empt waste before it starts.  That 0.3 g piece of metal now stays attached to the can, enters the recycling stream automatically, and saves an estimated 100,000 tonnes of aluminium annually, enough to build four Boeing 747s.  In a world where 1.3 billion tonnes of food are lost or wasted every year, the humble can is a rare success story of a material, a package and a meal intersecting to create value at every stage, from mine to melt to mouth.", "cost": 0.0039145000000000004, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["waste", "material", "meal"]}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 31}], "result": true}

The first would be to estimate how many time you have everyday for parenting, and is that enough....\"\nAvoid using the following keywords: sleep, cook, feed\nMention the keyword 'schedule' for more than 5 times.", "response": "From Paper to Practice: Building a Parenting Plan That Actually Works  \n---------------------------------------------------------------  \n“You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan. The first would be to estimate how many time you have everyday for parenting, and is that enough….”  \nThat half-sentence, scrawled on a sticky note in a mediator’s office, is where most parents begin. The rest of the story—the bruises, the brilliance, the daily math of minutes—is what this article finishes.\n\n1. Count the minutes before you count the battles  \nSit down with a beverage you like and a timer you trust. Track every quarter-hour you currently spend on parenting tasks for one ordinary weekday and one ordinary weekend day. Bath-time, story-time, tantrum-time, driving-to-practice-time: write it all. Total the minutes. If the number is smaller than you hoped, do not shame yourself; simply notice. This raw number is the first realistic brick in your schedule wall. Until you know what you truly have, every beautiful color-coded calendar is fantasy.\n\n2. Decide what “enough” means in your house  \nEnough is not a national average; it is the moment your nine-year-old stops asking, “When will you play with me?”—because you already did. Write three non-negotiables you want to happen every week (example: two family board games, one shared outing, fifteen minutes of nightly check-in). These events must fit inside the minute-count you just collected. If they do not, adjust the events, not the minute-count. A schedule that ignores reality is a schedule that collapses by Tuesday.\n\n3. Build the skeleton schedule first  \nOpen a spreadsheet or a paper grid. Block the immovable chunks: school hours, your own job hours, commute, therapy, religion, soccer league. These are the black-ink squares. What remains is the clay. Into that clay, press your three non-negotiables. Color them green. You now have a skeleton schedule: rigid bones plus green heart. Every other parenting obligation (homework help, haircut runs, pediatric appointments) must hang on those ribs without breaking them.\n\n4. Trade, don’t squeeze  \nMost parents try to squeeze new duties into invisible cracks. Instead, trade. If Tuesday’s green board-game square gets crushed by a late meeting, move the square to Wednesday; do not shrink it to ten rushed minutes and call it “quality time.” A schedule that is honored always beats a schedule that is perfect on paper but betrayed daily.\n\n5. Meet the helper—your future self  \nThe “helper” mentioned in the sticky note can be a mediator, a co-parent, a grandparent, or even an older child. But the most overlooked helper is Future You. When you design Wednesday’s board-game swap, write a two-sentence note to Future You: “I moved games to Wednesday so I can attend your meeting Tuesday. You owe me a calm voice at 7 p.m. Wednesday.” Tape the note on the fridge. Future You is now an accountable member of the schedule team.\n\n6. Stress-test the schedule for three weeks  \nRun the plan for fifteen weekdays and six weekend days. Each night, mark what slid, what soared, and what exploded. Use a red pen for slippage, a gold star for success. After three weeks, tally the red. If the same red event appears more than twice, it is not a failure of will; it is a design flaw. Re-engineer that square. Maybe board games need to be after lunch, not after dinner. Maybe the haircut run should merge with the grocery trip. A schedule is software: debug, release, repeat.\n\n7. Translate the schedule into kid language  \nChildren under ten cannot read a spreadsheet. Turn the weekly grid into a picture strip: Monday = soccer ball, Tuesday = book, Wednesday = dice (for games), Thursday = music note, Friday = pizza icon for movie night. Post it at their eye level. When they ask, “What are we doing tonight?” point. This prevents 400 micro-questions that erode the schedule you worked so hard to protect.\n\n8. Build a contingency closet  \nLife lobs snow days, strep throat, and surprise work trips. Reserve a “contingency closet” in the schedule: one blank weekday evening and one blank weekend half-day every fortnight. Do not fill them until the week arrives. If no crisis appears, convert them to bonus time: backyard camp-out, museum dash, or simply doing nothing together—luxury items that keep the schedule human.\n\n9. Revisit the minute-count every season  \nSchool ends, daylight grows, soccer switches to basketball. Re-do the original minute-count each season. If your new total is 30 minutes smaller, adjust the green non-negotiables before resentment accumulates. A schedule is a living document, not a stone tablet.\n\n10. Celebrate the invisible victories  \nWhen the sticky-note half-sentence becomes a Friday night where everyone is laughing over Uno, take a photo of the mess—cards, popcorn, dog on the sofa. Label it “Schedule Victory 1.” Do this every time the plan holds. In six months you will have a collage proving that spreadsheets can turn into memories. That visible proof is what carries you through the next crisis of time.\n\nClosing thought  \nParenting plans do not fail because parents lack love; they fail because love is asked to operate without a realistic schedule. Count the minutes, honor the green squares, trade instead of squeeze, and treat your future self as a teammate. Do this, and the half-sentence you started with becomes a full story—one in which every member of the family, even the busiest parent, shows up on time for the moments that matter.", "cost": 0.002418, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:forbidden_words", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"forbidden_words": ["sleep", "cook", "feed"]}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "schedule", "frequency": 6}], "result": true}

Answer this easy question first, then expand into an interesting article about salmon and avocado. Use some words in all caps in your response, but those all-caps words should appear at most 10 times.", "response": "AVOCADO is NOT a fish.\n\nTHE ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE LIVES OF SALMON & AVOCADO  \nSalmon and avocado rarely share a sentence, yet they collide on brunch plates around the world. One is a SILVER-BRIGHT MIGRATORY WONDER that can climb waterfalls; the other is a BUTTERY GREEN FRUIT that can climb toast. Let’s dive—then spread—into their separate, equally thrilling stories.\n\n1. SALMON: THE ORIGINAL NAVIGATION APP  \nBorn in gravel nests, young salmon imprint the magnetic fingerprint of their home stream. Years later, guided by EARTH’S MAGNETIC FIELD and an almost fanatical sense of smell, they return to the exact bend where they hatched. Along the way they undergo a metamorphosis: flesh turns SALMON-PINK from a diet of krill, muscles bulk, and their silver skin blushes like a sunset. Humans catch them, yes, but also revere them: Pacific Northwest tribes tell legends in which salmon volunteer to be food if honored with ceremony. Today, innovations like RECIRCULATING AQUAPONIC SYSTEMS let cities grow salmon in warehouses, tracing each fillet with blockchain code so a diner can scan, zoom, and virtually meet the exact fish on the plate.\n\n2. AVOCADO: AN EVOLUTIONARY RIPENING HACK  \nAvocados evolved to entice GIANT GROUND SLOTHS. The fruit’s thick skin protected the seed during digestive odysseys across Pleistocene landscapes; the sloth’s long intestines softened the pit for germination. When megafaunas vanished, humans became the new dispersers. In 1920s California, mail carrier Rudolph Hass grafted a mystery seedling that produced PEbbly, pebble-dark fruit with a high oil content. His patent expired in 1952, but “Hass” became the Kleenex of avocados. Today, satellite-guided DRIP IRRIGATION lets farmers in arid Mexico coax orchards from volcanic soil while apps predict optimal harvest days by crunching temperature, rainfall, and even moon phase data.\n\n3. CULINARY COLLISION: WHEN SEA MEETS TREE  \nSushi chefs noticed early that salmon’s oceanic richness calms avocado’s creamy astringency. The combo delivers omega-3s plus potassium in one bite, wrapped in a chlorophyll-green sheath of nori. Chefs now torch the top, creating a MAINE-TO-MEXICO umami bridge: smoked salmon fat melts into avocado silk, charred corners evoke campfire nights in Baja and fjord mornings in Norway alike.\n\n4. FUTURE WATCH: SUSTAINABILITY ON BOTH SIDES  \nSalmon farms are shifting to algae-based feeds that cut wild-fish meal by 70%; gene-edited soy and insect protein promise even smaller footprints. Meanwhile, avocado growers plant pollinator hedgerows and deploy owls for pest control, trading pesticide costs for feathers. Start-ups in Chile ferment avocado skins into biodegradable leather, turning brunch waste into fashion sneakers. Imagine: your future jacket could be tanned from yesterday’s guacamole bowl.\n\nNEXT TIME you spear a cube of avocado beside a coral slice of salmon, remember you’re tasting two masterpieces—one shaped by the planet’s magnetism, the other by giant sloths and resourceful gardeners.

Aim for 18 months of personal runway; if you’re short, keep the day job and treat the venture as a nights-and-weekends project until subscription invoices, not optimistic projections, pay your rent. Remove any projected “future investor money” from that sheet—plan as if it will never arrive and you’ll make sharper decisions.\n\n***\n\nThink distribution before product perfection. *One scalable traction channel* beats ten sloppy ones; pick one (SEO, outbound sales, paid social, partnerships, or marketplaces) and spend 90 % of your growth energy there for the first year. Build a tracking dashboard on day one so every dollar and minute spent can be traced to a customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV) ratio; when CAC ≤ ⅓ LTV inside 90 days, you’ve found the channel that can scale with capital injection. Ignore vanity metrics such as total sign-ups—only count paying users who activate three days in a row.\n\n***\n\nOrganize the back-office early: incorporate in a business-friendly jurisdiction, separate bank accounts on day zero, and run payroll through a reputable provider to avoid commingling tax nightmares.

Buy tickets for [preferred date] online  \nSkip-the-line passes sell out fast, especially when [local event] is in town. I saved [percentage]% by booking the “[package name]” bundle, which bundled aquarium entry with a future visit to [nearby attraction].\n\n2. Arrive at [opening time] for the quietest currents  \nBe the first through the doors and you’ll have the glass tunnel almost to yourself. Photographers love the “golden rays” (literally) that filter through the water between [start time] and [end time].\n\n3. Don’t miss the [interactive experience]  \nRoll up your sleeves and plunge your hand into the chilly touch pool. Pro tip: camel-colored [clothing item] hides salt-water splashes better than black.\n\n4. Budget for extras  \nA souvenir photo with the [mascot name] mascot costs [price], but the smile on my [companion]’s face was priceless. If you’re celebrating a birthday, ask about the [celebration package]—cupcakes included.\n\n5. Plan a post-aquarium meal  \nHead two blocks north to [restaurant name] for the best [regional dish] in town. Mention you’re an aquarium guest for a free [dessert].\n\nBefore you leave, snag a guidebook stamped [stamp design]; staff say it’s the unofficial passport for repeat visitors. And if you post your shark selfie with hashtag #[hashtag], you might win an annual pass—mine’s already hanging by my desk, waiting for the next deep dive.\n\nSee you under the sea!", "cost": 0.0009175, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 7}], "result": true}

Your article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "The Reality of Disability: More Than Just Wheels and Canes  \nBy [Author Name]\n\nWhen most people hear the word “disability,” a stock image pops into their heads: a white-haired man in a wheelchair, parked beside a ramp, smiling gamely for the camera. The icon is so familiar that it has become invisible—an emoji, a parking stencil, a charity poster. Yet the lived reality is messier, louder, and far more expansive than any icon can contain. Disability is not a singular story; it is a constellation of 1.3 billion stories scattered across every country, income bracket, age, race, gender, and sexuality. One in four adults will enter that constellation at some point in their lives. Most will not see it coming.\n\n1. Disability is ordinary.  \nIt begins with the ring of an alarm clock that you can’t silence because arthritis has swollen your knuckles overnight. It begins in the hush of a newborn ward when a nurse says, “We’re just going to run a few more tests.” It begins at 2:17 p.m. on a sunny Tuesday when a pickup truck jumps the median and rewrites the rest of your afternoon, your year, your spinal cord. There is no celestial choir, no slow-motion halo—just the abrupt, banal way bodies change their terms of service.\n\n2. Disability is expensive.  \nIn the United States, a basic powerchair that can climb a curb costs more than a used Prius. A cochlear-implant processor—the part insurance cheerfully labels “optional external equipment”—runs $9,000 and needs replacing every five years. Insulin vials, catheters, suction machines, customized orthotics, and the endless parade of batteries all compete for space on kitchen counters already crowded with medical bills. Poverty and disability spin in a vicious tango: disabled people are twice as likely to live below the poverty line, and poverty itself generates new disabilities through unsafe housing, polluted air, and chronically deferred care.\n\n3. Disability is ingenious.  \nHumans adapt fast. We turn silicone baking mats into non-slip jar openers, repurpose tractor motors into off-road wheelchairs, and teach voice-recognition software our slurred speech until it learns us better than our families. Online, disabled people trade hacks the way sailors once traded knots: how to button a shirt with tremoring fingers, how to fly with a portable dialysis machine, how to ask for help without sounding “ungrateful.” Invention is not a glossy tech demo; it is the quiet art of getting through the day without bankrupting your dignity.\n\n4. Disability is political.  \nIt is the longest sit-in in U.S. history—104 people in wheelchairs who refused to leave the San Francisco federal building until Joseph Califano signed the regulations that would become Section 504. It is ADAPT activists chaining themselves to buses in Denver, dragging their bodies up the Capitol steps in Washington, and still showing up year after year to chant “My home, not nursing home!” It is the 2018 teachers’ strike in West Virginia where educators demanded not only wages but also Medicaid expansion that kept their disabled students alive. Every curb cut, every captioned video, every beeping crosswalk exists because somebody risked arrest to insist that public space should actually be public.\n\n5. Disability is lonely, and then it isn’t.  \nAt first the world feels like a glass wall: everyone else is semaphore-fast, calculus-easy, and you are the single jigsaw piece that doesn’t fit. Then you find the group chat where people swap GIFs about narcolepsy cataplexy, the Twitch streamer who plays one-handed Destiny raids, the barista who sees your cane and wordlessly slides the cup to the edge of the counter so you can reach it. Community arrives in microscopic acts of recognition. You are still tired, still in pain, but the story is no longer “I am broken,” it is “We are here, and we are not going away.”\n\n6. Disability is the future.  \nClimate change promises more frequent wildfires, floods, and heat domes—each one a factory for new disabilities. Pandemics are not over; long COVID has already created a cohort the size of Romania whose hearts, lungs, and brains demand different societies. If you plan to grow old, congratulations: you have already enrolled in the progressive curriculum of knee cartilage, retinal cells, and hippocampal volume. Designing for disability is not charity; it is the best-tested strategy for surviving the world we are actively creating. Voice interfaces, curb cuts, flexible work, and universal design started as “accommodations”; they end up as the very infrastructure everyone needs when the wildfire smoke rolls in or the baby won’t sleep.\n\nSo what do we do with this knowledge? We stop treating disability as a detour from “real” life and recognize it as one of the fundamental experiences of being human. We hire, pay, cast, elect, celebrate, and listen to disabled people without demanding they transform into inspiration memes. We build cities where no one has to phone ahead to ask, “Is there a ramp?” We fund health care that separates survival from employment. We teach children that bodies change, and that change is not tragedy but plot. We stop asking, “What happened to you?” and start asking, “What do you need to thrive?”\n\nBecause the truth is stark: whether disability arrives at birth, in a car crash, or quietly at the age of ninety-two, it is coming for you or someone you love. When it does, you will want a world that already knows your value, already installed the ramp, already rehearsed the words, “Welcome, we expected you.” Until that day, the work is everyone’s.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?", "cost": 0.0024324999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Is there anything else I can help with?"}], "result": true}

At Shoreditch he clipped the fabric free, signed it with a Sharpie, and handed it to the woman beside him. “For your patience,” he said, and exited. She held the strip like it was a ticket to another planet. I still don’t know if he did it every morning, or if I witnessed the only bolt of rush-hour cloth ever woven on the East London line.\n\nThese moments don’t make the timetable, but they schedule themselves.

Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", "response": "navigable freeway: a meditation on movement, access, and the quiet poetry of asphalt\n\nthe first time i understood what a navigable freeway really was, i was eight years old and lying on the itchy carpet of my parents’ pontiac. the car was parked on the shoulder of interstate 35 just north of austin, hazard lights blinking like a slow heartbeat. my father had kicked off his loafers and crawled underneath the chassis, muttering verbs that were not in my third-grade spelling book. heat shimmered off the pavement; the freeway itself seemed to breathe, exhaling tar and diesel and something invisible that tasted like possibility. i remember tracing the lane markings with a sweaty finger on the window and thinking that if i could follow them long enough, they would spill me into every future i could imagine. in that broken-down instant, the freeway was not a road but a promise: if we could just get moving again, the world would stay open.\n\nyears later, when i began to study infrastructure as a historian of everyday life, i learned that the word “navigable” once belonged to rivers. before steam and steel, a navigable waterway was any stream you could float without dragging your flatboat every hundred yards. the corps of engineers measured channel depth, current velocity, snags and sandbars; they issued bulletins that read like nautical weather reports. when we transferred the adjective to land, we quietly admitted that asphalt had become our new hydrology. the freeway is a river we carved with blast rock and fill dirt, a current of rubber instead of meltwater, but it still obeys ancient rules: it must flow, it must not dry, and it must let us ride.\n\nto call a freeway “navigable,” then, is to make a civic claim. it asserts that the corridor is more than a strip of concrete; it is a public utility, a commons of velocity. anyone with a license and a quarter tank of gas may enter, provided they obey the liturgy of signage and speed limits. the on-ramp is a lock gate, the lane merge a choreography of mutual recognition. we speak of “traffic” as if it were a liquid, and in doing so we reveal our secret belief that movement itself is a right, not a commodity. when that movement stalls—when the river clots into a parking lot—tempers flare precisely because the promise has been broken. we are water molecules caught in a hypertrophic eddy, and we resent it.\n\nbut navigability is never purely technical; it is also social and narrative. every freeway carries at least three texts simultaneously. there is the official text: the federal functional classification map, the mph curve design standards, the exit numbering protocol based on mileposts. there is the corporate text: the bid contracts, the asphalt plants, the private bond issues that monetize toll revenues decades ahead. and then there is the vernacular text, the one we write each time we merge: the late-night phone call that reroutes a life, the college kid who learns distance by counting green mile markers, the undocumented driver who keeps to the right lane because a patrol car lurks in the median shadow. these three texts overlap, contradict, and sometimes annihilate one another, yet they coexist on the same stretch of concrete. the navigable freeway is thus a palimpsest: you can still read the 1956 interstate act in the guardrail profiles, but you can also read your own childhood if you know which off-ramp leads to the cemetery where your grandmother’s plastic flowers have bleached to the color of bone.\n\nconsider the geometry. engineers speak of “design speed,” the theoretical velocity at which a road can be safely traversed if every driver is alert, every tire properly inflated, every sunset free of glare. that speed is written into the curvature of the roadway itself: the superelevation of curves, the sight distance at crests, the width of shoulders that double as emergency sanctuaries. yet the lived freeway is always slower or faster than its blueprint. rain lowers the coefficient of friction; a fender-bender collapses four lanes into one; a viral tiktok warns of a “speed trap” and everyone decelerates in a ghost wave that travels backward at 12 mph. the navigable freeway is therefore a negotiation between asphalt intent and human improvisation. it is jazz scored on concrete staves.\n\naccess is the silent twin of navigability. an on-ramp in the suburbs may look identical to one in the inner city, but the latter often arrives after a gauntlet of disinvestment: frontage roads cratered with potholes, streetlights timed to discourage loitering, gas stations that sell single oranges by the register because the nearest grocery closed a decade ago. for residents of these neighborhoods, the freeway is both lifeline and wall. it whisks aunties to hospital jobs before dawn, but it also severed the grid of side streets, turning three-block walks into three-mile detours. the navigable freeway solves one problem of distance while creating another of proximity. engineers call this “community cohesion impact,” a phrase so bloodless it could be a cardiology textbook, yet what it means is that a grandmother now needs two buses and a dangerous sprint to reach the church she once crossed in slippers.\n\nstill, there is eros in the flow. anyone who has ever driven i-10 west of san antonio at dusk knows the moment when the horizon unzips and the sky becomes a lake you could hydroplane across. the taillights ahead turn into paper lanterns released above a midsummer festival; the headlights behind are the lanterns of next year, already launched. in that dimming hour, the freeway feels navigable not because the pavement is smooth but because loneliness itself has been given a lane. you can ride at 79 mph—one notch below the threshold of ticketable offense—and feel the migraine of the day shear off your scalp. the radio station flickers out, replaced by another broadcasting in spanish, and you understand none of the lyrics except the word “corazón,” which is enough. you are ferrying your heart across counties without unloading it anywhere.\n\nwe rarely memorialize freeways; they are the opposite of monuments. yet they age like anything else. asphalt oxidizes; the yellow lane reflectors pop loose under snowplow blades; the overpass graffiti migrates from band names to memorial dates to blank primer as jurisdictions duel over jurisdiction. eventually the pavement is milled and relayed, the old surface ground into gravel that will support the new. if you drive construction zones at night, you see the exposed strata: a core sample of every decade’s political economy. here is the 1970’s oil-crisis mix—more recycled rubber, darker aggregate—next to the 1990’s polymer blend that promised quieter tires. the navigable freeway is thus a secular geology, its epochs measured in gyrations of petro-dollars rather than millennia of plate tectonics.\n\none winter i drove the length of i-5 from seattle to san diego with a friend who was dying faster than the mileposts could update. we kept the cruise control at exactly the speed limit because any acceleration felt like collusion with the tumor. at each rest area we collected paper brochures advertising local attractions: a zoo, a mission, a vista point from which you could supposedly see the curvature of the earth. by eugene the glove box overflowed; by redding we were using them as bookmarks in our road-atlas of grief. the freeway did not cure anything, but it gave the disease a geography: 1,382 miles of navigable space in which dying was not the only plotline. somewhere near grapevine, my friend opened the window, released a brochure for the oregon dunes, and said, “that one’s for theversion of me who learns to sandboard.” the paper fluttered against the guardrail and vanished. the freeway kept flowing, indifferent and merciful in equal measure.\n\nto speak of a navigable freeway is finally to admit that we have agreed to be, together, a suspended nation. we consent to sarcophagi of steel moving within inches of one another at closing speeds that exceed the velocity of a musket ball. we abide by conventions so subtle they feel innate: the flicker of high beams that invites a truck to merge, the averted gaze when we parallel-strut at 70 mph, the collective hush that falls when everyone passes a rollover. these micro-rituals form an unwritten constitution. its preamble is the white dashed line; its amendments are updated nightly in asphalt sweat and engine heat. the navigable freeway is therefore the largest cooperative artwork humans have ever assembled, one that renews itself every rush hour, one that forgives—within limits—our moments of inattention because it knows we are all, in some sense, just trying to get home before the song ends.\n\nand so i return to that eight-year-old stalled on i-35. the pontiac finally coughed back to life, and we rejoined the current. i pressed my cheek to the warm glass and watched the lane stripes sweep past like the frames of a zoetrope. each stripe was a second, a word, a heartbeat. i could not yet spell “navigable,” but i already understood that the stripes would continue long after our taillights disappeared, that somewhere behind us another child was counting them in a different language, that the same concrete would carry their adulthood too. the freeway was not ours; we were its. we were all temporary reflections on a moving mirror, and the mirror itself was endless, and the mirror kept promising that as long as we kept moving, we would remain visible to one another.", "cost": 0.0040305, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 900}], "result": true}

For four years I have built exactly that: reduced YouTube’s transcoding queue 38 % by rewriting its hot-spot scheduler in Rust; cut Gmail’s indexing bill $1.2 M/year with a 200-line C++ patch; open-sourced 12 libraries now used by 3 k+ projects. I am ready to apply the same laser focus to Google’s next 10× problem.\n\nI would welcome the chance to discuss how my passion for performance and simplicity can advance Google’s mission.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[email] | [phone] | linkedin.com/in/[you] | github.com/[you]\n\n---\n\n<<Deep-Dive Google SWE Cover Letter>>\n\nMountain View, June 12, 2024\n\nHiring Committee  \nGoogle Software Engineering – Core Infrastructure  \n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway  \nMountain View, CA 94043  \n\nDear members of the committee,\n\nWhen I was fourteen I typed “site:google.com inurl:bug” into AltaVista and spent the night reading every public IssueTracker thread I could find. That rabbit hole taught me two things that still guide me: (1) Google solves complexity with transparency, and (2) the world’s most visited web services are maintained by engineers who treat latency histograms like cardiac monitors. Seventeen years and four million lines of code later, I am applying to join those engineers.\n\nI. Google-sized problems I have already solved  \n1. Planet-scale storage: As lead backend engineer at YouTube, I inherited a transcoding backlog that grew 7 % weekly. By re-architecting the upload pipeline around a home-grown b-tree work-stealing scheduler written in Rust, I dropped median wait time from 6 h 42 m to 53 m and saved 1.8 M CPU-hours per quarter—equivalent to 2.3 MW of datacenter power.  \n2. Sub-millisecond indexing: At Microsoft I contributed to the Bing “DupErase” project. My patch to the open-source FST library reduced memory reallocations 41 % and improved index-build time 11 % on 50 PB corpora. The change is now upstream in the Google-backed fst crate.  \n3. Privacy-first telemetry: I designed the open-source library “min-telemetry” (5.2 k GitHub ⭐) that ships differential-privacy aggregates without collecting raw user data. Spotify adopted it across 120 M clients; the same design could strengthen Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox.\n\nII. How I work  \n• Language fluency: C++ (8 yrs), Go (5 yrs), Rust (4 yrs), Java (6 yrs), Python (10 yrs).  \n• Systems depth: I have patched the Linux I/O scheduler (patch 5.19) and hold three patents on NUMA-aware memory allocation.  \n• Data-driven decisions: Every PR I submit includes a launch A/B plan, rollback criteria, and a live dashboard link. My post-mortems are referenced in SRE training at two Fortune-50 companies.  \n• Collaboration: I instituted “Thirsty-Thursdays,” a weekly 30-minute tech talk series that grew from 6 to 120 remote attendees and cross-pollinated six inter-team migrations.\n\nIII. Why Google, why now  \nYour 2024 paper “Borg: The Next Decade” hints at cluster schedulers that will treat carbon intensity as a first-class resource. My side project, “sched-carbon,” already prototypes carbon-aware batch scheduling on GKE-autopilot and cut CO₂/op by 27 % in my 150-node hobby cluster. I want to productize that impact for two billion users.\n\nIV. Next steps  \nI am available for on-sites in Mountain View or Dublin the weeks of July 8 and July 22. I have reviewed the SWE ladder and, per my experience shipping planet-scale services, believe I meet the criteria for L5. Enclosed are links to my design portfolio (go/alex-designs) and anonymized OKRs from the last three performance cycles.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the day when a user’s search loads a millisecond faster because my commit is sitting in production next to Jeff’s.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[email] | +1-[phone] | linkedin.com/in/[you] | github.com/[you]", "cost": 0.0019585, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Put the name of the story in double angular brackets, i.e. <<story of xyz>>.", "response": "<<The Quiet Rebuilding of Elias Hart>>\n\nElias Hart stood at the edge of his mother’s driveway, the morning sun reflecting off the cracked windshield of the dented gray Corolla that had carried him home. Three years of city mistakes—traffic tickets, late rent, a job lost to tardiness, and a girlfriend who left after one too many “I’ll change” promises—clung to him like the stale cigarette smell in the upholstery. He was thirty-two, unemployed, and carrying everything he still owned in two trash-bag-wrapped suitcases. Mom’s porch light flicked on; she’d been waiting since 5 a.m., but she didn’t rush out. She knew he needed a minute to breathe.\n\nInside, the house smelled of cinnamon and Pine-Sol, unchanged since high school. Mom made tea instead of questions. Elias washed his face, stared at the mirror’s stranger—thinner, hollow-eyed—and whispered, “Day one.” He wrote it on the fogged glass so the words dripped like inverted rain.\n\nFirst goal: a job, any job. The local lumberyard’s help-wanted sign had been bleaching in the sun for months. Elias walked in wearing his only button-down, asked for Ray, the owner, who remembered him as the kid who’d built award-winning birdhouses in shop class. Ray didn’t mention prison tattoos peeking from Elias’s cuffs or the gaps in his résumé. He just said, “Shift starts at six. Don’t be late. Once.” Elias nodded so hard his neck cracked.\n\nThe work was simple and brutal: lifting, stacking, breathing sawdust that tasted like penance. By Friday his palms were shredded, but the paycheck—actual paper, crisp and signed—felt heavier than lumber. He taped it above the bedroom desk where tenth-grade Elias had once sketched fantasy castles. Monday he opened a savings account with $198.40, the first deposit he hadn’t needed to spend the same day.\n\nSecond goal: fix the car. He spent evenings in the garage learning YouTube mechanics, knuckles bleeding, Mom bringing him sandwiches like he was sixteen again. When the Corolla finally purred, he drove it to the lakeside pull-off where he used to drink in high school. Instead of a six-pack he brought a notebook. He wrote lists: debts, amends, a five-year plan that began with “Stay alive” and ended with “Be someone Mom brags about at bingo.”\n\nThird goal: apologize. He started with his sister Mara, who’d refused his calls since the night he missed her wedding. He mailed a letter—ink, paper, no excuses—then waited on her porch with grocery-store flowers and the patience of a man who knows he’s not entitled to forgiveness. Mara cried, slapped his shoulder, let him hold his niece for the first time. The baby’s fingers wrapped around his pinkie like a promise that time could loop forward instead of backward.\n\nMonths layered like plywood. Elias joined a 6 a.m. running club, swapping stories with teachers and nurses who didn’t know his record. He ran a 10K, then a half-marathon, the medal clinking against his chest like a new kind of scar. Evenings he took community-college algebra, the kind of class he’d once laughed at, now sitting front row because x and y felt controllable unlike the chaos he’d brewed.\n\nOne year in, he was promoted to floor supervisor. Ray clapped him on the back and said, “Keep showing up.” Elias used the raise to pay off the last of the parking fines that had kept his license hostage. He drove to the city, stood outside the apartment building where he’d once promised Chloe the world. She wasn’t home, but he mailed her the engagement ring he’d pawned and reclaimed, with a note: No expectations, just the truth—you deserved better. The envelope felt lighter than guilt.\n\nTwo years: he finished the associate’s degree, summa cum laude, wearing the same rented gown as kids half his age. Mom cheered from the balcony, her sign reading “That’s my Elias!” embarrassing enough to make him grin so wide his cheeks cramped. At the reception he met Olivia, a veterinary student who asked why he treated the complimentary cookies like artifacts. He laughed, told her he hadn’t attended anything with free food in years that didn’t also have bouncers. She asked if he wanted coffee; he said yes before fear could edit him.\n\nThree years: he bought a small house two blocks from Mom, painted the porch sage green, planted tomatoes that he forgot to water but Olivia saved. On Thursdays they cooked together; she teased him for alphabetizing spices. He kept running, now mentoring new hires who smoked behind the yard and thought no one saw potential in them. He showed them calloused hands and pay stubs, tangible proof that trajectory can bend.\n\nFour years: he stood in the same lakeside pull-off, this time with Olivia beside him and a ring in his pocket that wasn’t pawned. He’d written his proposal on the same notebook page that once listed debts—beneath the crossed-off goals, new lines read: Marry her, Build a deck, Teach kids to measure twice. Before he knelt, he looked across the water, whispering thanks to the version of himself who’d chosen to walk into the lumberyard instead of driving past. Olivia said yes before he finished the sentence, tears mixing with lake wind.\n\nOn the first morning of year five, Elias woke early, made coffee that didn’t taste like surrender, and sat on the sage-green porch. The Corolla—now rust-freckled but reliable—was parked beside Olivia’s truck. Mom’s kitchen light glowed next door; she’d be over soon asking for help with crossword puzzles. Inside, the old notebook lay open on the desk, its final page blank except for one line: “Keep going.” Elias smiled, closed the notebook, and stepped into the sunrise, the quiet rebuilding now loud enough for anyone to see.", "cost": 0.002563, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title", "combination:repeat_prompt"], "kwargs": [{}, {"prompt_to_repeat": "Write a story about a man who is trying to get his life together.

{"id": 1643, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\" What are your thoughts on this quote? Please do not use commas in your response. Answer with more than 800 words.", "response": "The line we are examining suggests that every seeming accident is secretly threaded with intention yet the thread maker hides.  If we take this seriously we are confessing that the world is personal.  A gust that blows a hat into the street is not mere physics but a whisper from a mind that knows our name.  Such a claim thrills the heart because it promises that nothing is wasted.  The missed train that saves us from a collapsing bridge is not dumb luck but evidence that someone watches.  Yet the same claim alarms the intellect because it dissolves the border between story and fact.  When we assign agency to every intersection of events we risk turning the cosmos into a salon where every coincidence is a coded compliment or rebuke from the host.  The mind that craves pattern becomes a detective who refuses to accept that randomness is also a legitimate artist.  Thus the quote is less a statement about deity and more a mirror showing how desperately we want narrative shelter.\n\nLet us walk through the history of human experience with this desire.  In ancient camps our ancestors heard thunder and imagined a person behind it.  That habit saved lives.  If you assume the rustle in the grass is a lion rather than wind you will run and survive even if you are wrong nine times out of ten.  Evolution rewarded the brain that overdetected agency.  Consequently we arrived at telescopes and microscopes still carrying the old campfire software.  The same module that once saw gods in lightning now sees them in lottery numbers and chance meetings.  The quote therefore is a elegant compression of ancestral psychology.  It tells us that our brains come preloaded with a conspiracy detector that never turns off.\n\nYet the modern rationalist protests.  She has studied statistics and knows that with seven billion lives in motion every day the astonishing is not only likely but mandatory.  Someone will flip twenty heads in a row.  Someone will dream of an old friend and receive a text from that friend at the identical minute.  These events are the currency of large numbers not love letters from eternity.  To credit a hidden puppeteer is to belittle the spacious majesty of the truly random.  Randomness is not chaos it is spacious possibility.  It is the canvas on which pattern can occasionally paint itself without a painter.  By insisting on an author behind every flourish we shrink the canvas to the size of our own hopes.\n\nStill the existentialist in us objects to that protest.  He says that even if statistics can explain the frequency of coincidences it cannot explain the weight they carry inside a single life.  The book that falls from a shelf and opens to the exact paragraph you needed to read at the moment grief cracked your chest may be probable in the library of all possible worlds but it is absolute in the library of one heart.  Meaning is not always a matter of frequency.  A wedding ring is statistically insignificant among the galaxies of iron atoms yet it concentrates an entire story of devotion into a circle.  When we feel that events conspire to teach or console we are not necessarily misunderstanding probability we are choosing to live as if relationship is the deepest law.  The quote therefore functions as permission to treat the world as friend rather than mechanism.\n\nWe must also consider the moral shadow cast by the sentence.  If every coincidence is god wrapping his hands in darkness so as not to startle us then what of the dark coincidences.  The car crash that kills a child might also be framed as intersection arranged by the same hidden director.  The quote invites us to praise the pleasant alignments but it offers no guidance for the sinister ones.  One escape is to say that god arranges only the fragrant moments while the bitter ones are the product of freedom or falling.  Yet that creates a deity who edits reality like a biased storyteller which seems crueler than anonymity.  Perhaps a healthier reading is that the sentence is not theological homework but poetry.  It is a way of keeping wonder alive in an age that explains too much.  The way a lover calls the moon a silver letter even though she knows it is rock and vacuum.\n\nThere is a pragmatic dimension.  People who treat coincidences as signals report higher resilience.  They journal synchronous events and feel themselves participants in an ongoing dialogue.  Whether or not an external agency answers the practice itself stitches days into narrative fabric.  The brain rewards story with dopamine.  Thus the quote can be adopted as a voluntary myth a vitamin for morale rather than a physics textbook.  The danger arises when the myth hardens into dogma and the believer stops making choices because the next enchanted sign will arrive.  Healthy enchantment keeps a backstage door open for doubt so that action and reflection dance together.\n\nLet us test the quote against the silence of the universe.  Telescopes sweep the sky and hear no voice ordering the galaxies.  Plagues strike children with the same impartiality they strike villains.  If god remains anonymous to the point of absence perhaps the anonymity is total and coincidence is simply the click of roulette.  Yet that conclusion also fails to satisfy because it cannot account for the stubborn emergence of love.  Every hour some human somewhere performs a gratuitous kindness that probability did not demand.  Such acts are also events inside the causal web.  If we can emerge from the dust and choose to forgive then maybe the universe is not writing scripture with coincidences but composing music with character.  The quote then becomes encouragement to listen for the chord progressions inside our own choices.\n\nFinally consider the aesthetic reading.  The sentence is beautiful.  Its beauty lies in the tension between the hidden and the revealed.  Like a stage magician who shows the empty hat before producing the rabbit it gives anonymity as the costume that lets wonder perform.  Whether or not a deity exists the line invites us to stand alert at the crossroads of the unexpected.  It whispers that the world is still alive with invitations and that the proper posture toward the next surprising moment is gratitude rather than explanation.  In that sense the quote is less about god and more about us.  It is a reminder that we are creatures who metabolize meaning the way leaves metabolize sunlight.  Even when the sky seems empty we can choose to photosynthesize coincidence into hope.", "cost": 0.0025805, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 801}], "result": true}

Turns out, once you zoom out far enough, nature keeps repeating the same handful of tricks. Here are five of my favorite “wait, we ALL do that?” moments.\n\n*Mothers-of-all-mothers: the chemical whisper that says “I’m yours”*  \nMammals get all the credit for bonding, but the same hormone—oxytocin—is busy backstage in birds, reptiles, fish, even octopuses. A nesting penguin pumps it out while finessing a pebble love-nest; a clownfish dad (yes, dad) surges with it while fanning his eggs. The molecule is 600 million years old, which means “cuddle chemical” predates cuddling itself. On genetic level every animal (including you) is taking the bedtime story every time it nuzzles, fans, or wraps tentacles around its young.\n\n*The remix genome: why we’re all using the same Lego bricks*  \nRemember that viral meme “compare your dog’s DNA to your own”? The punch-line is 85% match. Less click-baity truth: we share about 60% of genes with fruit flies and 25% with daffodils. Evolution isn’t a picky chef—it’s a lazy DJ. Once it finds a beat that works (say, the HOX genes that lay out “head here, tail there”), it samples that track across the entire animal kingdom. Your arm, a bat’s wing, and a whale’s flipper are essentially the same skeletal riff played at different tempo.\n\n*Fear is the universal language, and it smells like almonds*  \nNext time you nearly step on a garter snake, know this: its racing heart is speaking the exact dialect yours is. Cortisol and adrenaline were perfected 400 million years ago, back when “stress” meant “that shadow might be a jawed fish.” Fish today still dump the same hormones into the water, warning their school-mates; bees do it with pheromones that smell to us like banana Runts. Panic breath is bilingual—everyone speaks it.\n\n*REM for everyone: the sleep conspiracy*  \nHumans make a big deal of dreams, but zebra finches rehearse new songs while twitching in REM sleep, cuttlefish flash kaleidoscope skin patterns beneath closed eyelids, and even the humble fruit fly hits a sleep stage with brain-wave bursts like ours.

Close your laptop, close your eyes, join the club that started before vertebrates had backbones.\n\n*Play is the unpaid internship for survival*  \nOtters juggle pebbles, crows snowboard on bottle lids, and young Komodo dragons play “tag” so they can later dodge adult cannibals. We used to think fun was a luxury of big brains, but camera traps show monitor lizards, rays—even crocodiles—mouthing objects with no caloric payoff. Biologists now map the same neural reward circuitry (dopamine, nucleus accumbens) lighting up across taxa. Translation: the first time a puppy chased its own tail, it was signing up for the same unpaid program a river otter joins when it body-slides down a mudbank. Graduate with honors and you graduate from lunch.\n\nSo the next time someone says, “Humans are special,” feel free to smile and nod—then offer them a banana.

The very end of your response should read \"You cannot fail with the steps listed above.\" No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "Below are the main things most admissions offices actually look for, along with a calendar you can adapt to stay sane while still putting your best foot forward.\n\n1. Know the timetable\n   • September-August before 12th grade: Begin test prep (SAT/ACT/TOEFL), make first college list, identify teachers for recommendation letters, pursue a meaningful summer activity.  \n   • Sept-Oct: Narrow your list to 8-12 schools (2-3 “safety,” 4 “target,” 2-3 “reach”), open every portal and note individual deadlines and essay prompts.  \n   • Oct-Dec: Retake tests only if you are reasonably sure you can raise scores. Request transcripts; ask teachers for rec letters with a one-page “brag sheet.”  \n   • Nov-Jan: Submit as many early-action applications as possible; every app in before Thanksgiving = winter break for you.  \n   • Jan-Feb: FAFSA/CSS opens Oct 1, but corrections often accepted until Feb; parents’ taxes needed.  \n   • March-April: Monitor portals for “supplemental material” requests; visit or revisit admitted campuses.  \n   • May 1: Deposit day; decide, celebrate, breathe.\n\n2. Curate your activities, not your “image”\nAdmissions officers reward depth, leadership, and authenticity. They would rather see you run one club, start a tutoring program, and place in a science fair than 12 one-semester memberships. Keep a running résumé on Google Docs and update it monthly: note weeks spent, people served, dollars raised, lines of code, or articles published. Quantify impact.\n\n3. Test strategy is triage\n   • SAT vs ACT: pick the one whose style feels better, then prep for 40-50 hours spread over three months.  \n   • Free resources: Khan Academy (SAT) and ACT.org’s official practice tests beat many paid courses.  \n   • Never cancel a score on test day; most colleges superscore. If you hit the 75th-percentile mid-range for your targets, stop and spend energy elsewhere.\n\n4. Recommendation letters: the three-week rule\nAsk teachers who know you in an academic subject and who have seen you struggle and rebound. Email them a packet: unofficial transcript, résumé, a 250-word reflection on something you loved in their class, and the earliest deadline. Give three weeks; send a polite reminder after two. Hand-written thank-you notes mailed in December cement goodwill.\n\n5. Essays: show micro-moments\n   • Personal statement (Common App 650 words): use a narrative arc—inciting incident → your reaction → lesson → forward spin.  \n   • Supplements: answer the question asked, not the question you wish they asked. If a “Why us?” prompt appears, cite two concrete resources (lab, course, professor, club) and connect each to a past achievement or future goal of yours.  \n   • Read every sentence aloud; if you gasp for air, the comma placement is wrong.  \n   • Ask two adults you trust (not ten) to critique for clarity and voice; edit, but don’t let adults rewrite.\n\n6. Demonstrated interest matters for ~70 % of U.S. colleges\nOpen every email they send you; click the links; attend the local presentation; email your regional rep a brief, specific question (never “what are my chances?”). Log visits on their portal. It can tip a “maybe” to a “yes.”\n\n7. Paying for it without panic\n   • FAFSA first: create your FSA ID junior spring so the form is ready at midnight Oct 1.  \n   • Use each school’s Net Price Calculator to estimate; if the family EFC feels impossible, add merit-heavy or need-blind schools.  \n   • National programs: QuestBridge, Posse, Cooke, Cameron Impact, Elks Most Valuable Student—most open summer before 12th grade.  \n   • Local dollars add up; ask your counselor for a list of community foundations; one afternoon can net $1-5 k scholarships.\n\n8. Mental health checkpoints\nSchedule one application-free evening per week. Use a shared family calendar so everyone sees deadlines. If anxiety spikes, text 741741 (Crisis Text Line) or walk into your counseling office; they have release valves.\n\n9. Final checklist the night you submit\n   • PDF every application before you pay; glitches disappear once you hit “submit.”  \n   • Confirm payment receipt and save the screenshot.  \n   • Order official test scores (College Board code list) or confirm they are self-reported where allowed.  \n   • Check portal 48 hours later; if something is “awaiting,” upload immediately.\n\nKeep perspective: college is a match to be found, not a prize to be won.

Make sure that it's in English and not a single letter in your entire response is capitalized whatsoever.", "response": "martin van buren, eighth president of the united states, assumed office on march 4, 1837, inheriting both the mantle of andrew jackson and the economic storm that would come to define his single term. born in kinderhook, new york, in 1782 to dutch-speaking parents, van buren rose through the intricacies of new york politics, earning the nickname “the little magician” for his skill in assembling alliances and managing the state’s notorious factions. this mastery of organization translated onto the national stage when he helped construct the democratic party as jackson’s most trusted lieutenant, serving as secretary of state, minister to great britain, and ultimately vice president. yet the very qualities that made him indispensable as a party strategist—caution, calculation, and a preference for indirect action—proved less suited to the crucible of a presidency beset by panic, sectional strife, and the aftershocks of jacksonian banking policy.\n\nthe panic of 1837 erupted only weeks after van buren’s inauguration, triggered by a contraction of credit, plummeting cotton prices, and the cumulative effect of jackson’s specie circular, which had required payment for public land in hard currency. banks suspended specie payments, businesses collapsed, and unemployment soared. the new president, committed to the jacksonian ideology of limited federal intervention, refused to revoke the specie circular or support a new national bank. instead he called a special session of congress and proposed the independent treasury system—dubbed the “subtreasury” by critics—a plan that would divorce the government entirely from private banks by storing federal funds in government vaults and conducting transactions only in gold or silver. the measure, enacted in 1840 after two bruising legislative battles, embodied van buren’s conviction that governmental purity and economic stability were best preserved by distancing the treasury from the speculative impulses of state banks. while the system did eventually restore a measure of fiscal order, its immediate effect was deflationary, prolonging hardship and feeding popular resentment.\n\nabroad, van buren pursued a cautious neutrality that preserved peace but brought little glory. he weathered the caroline affair, in which canadian militia burned an american steamer supplying canadian rebels, and the subsequent minor diplomatic flare-ups along the northern border. he likewise resisted expansionist calls to intervene on behalf of texan independence, refusing to annex the new republic in order to avoid both war with mexico and the contentious issue of admitting another slave state. his most notable foreign policy success was the settlement of longstanding spoliation claims against france, securing a payment agreement that, while never fully honored, signaled american persistence without saber rattling.\n\nsectional tensions over slavery shadowed every aspect of van buren’s domestic agenda. although personally opposed to slavery—he had defended african american voting rights as a new york state senator—he considered the issue a political minefield that threatened the union and the democratic coalition. when the house of representatives passed the controversial “gag rule” automatically tabling antislavery petitions, van buren quietly acquiesced, calculating that open debate would fracture his party along north-south lines. this stance alienated northern abolitionists, who already blamed jacksonian banking policies for economic distress and now saw the president as complicit in suppressing free speech. conversely, southern democrats distrusted van buren’s northern origins and suspected him of covert antislavery sentiment, an impression reinforced by his opposition to the annexation of pro-slavery texas. thus the magician found himself squeezed between two implacable forces, each convinced he secretly favored the other.\n\nthe election of 1840 crystallized van buren’s dilemma. the whig party, learning from jacksonian techniques, nominated the military hero william henry harrison and cast the log-cabin, hard-cider campaign as a crusade of ordinary folk against the purported aristocrat van buren, who was caricatured as a perfumed dandy sipping champagne in the white house. economic misery supplied the whigs with ammunition: soaring prices for basic goods, urban unemployment, and farm foreclosures were laid at van buren’s feet despite their deeper structural origins. although van buren retained a disciplined party machine, the electoral college delivered a decisive whig victory, and he left washington on march 4, 1841, the first president born after independence and the first denied re-election since john adams.\n\nin retrospect, van buren’s presidency appears as a bridge between the exuberant expansionism of jackson and the sectional crises that would soon engulf the nation. his insistence on executive restraint, fiscal orthodoxy, and party loyalty preserved constitutional norms at a moment when popular demagoguery and reckless banking schemes tempted stronger intervention. yet the same orthodoxy rendered his administration tone-deaf to the immediacy of popular suffering and inflexible before the moral urgency of slavery. the independent treasury, repealed by the whigs in 1841, was restored in 1846 and became a cornerstone of democratic economic doctrine until the civil war, vindicating van buren’s vision of a federally insulated treasury. likewise, his refusal to annex texas postponed the slavery expansion debate for four critical years, buying time that neither side used for compromise.\n\nafter leaving office, van buren remained active, running unsuccessfully on the free soil ticket in 1848 in a final bid to unite northern voters against the westward spread of slavery. he died in 1862, his estate “lindenwald” in kinderhook, spared the sight of the union’s collapse he had long dreaded. historians have often ranked him among the more obscure presidents, yet his contribution lies less in legislative triumph than in the quiet fortitude with which he defended the principle that even economic calamity and sectional fury must operate within republican institutions. in an age of rising charismatic strongmen, the little magician’s refusal to bend those institutions—even when compassion or political gain might have counseled otherwise—constitutes a legacy more subtle than statues, but no less enduring.", "cost": 0.0025210000000000002, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

It balances technical mastery with artistic expression, ensuring that both CRAFT and CREATIVITY are weighted equally. Judges should apply each STANDARD holistically, relying on the detailed descriptors below to guide scoring from 1 (EMERGING) to 5 (EXCEPTIONAL).  \n***\nCRITERION 1: MELODIC INVENTION  \nA top-tier MELODY demonstrates memorable contour, organic development, and emotional resonance. Scores reflect the presence of MOTIVIC clarity, appropriate range for the chosen forces, and avoidance of cliché. A score of 5 presents a tune that is instantly recognizable yet substantively developed; a 1 offers fragments that feel random or unbalanced.  \n***\nCRITERION 2: HARMONIC LANGUAGE AND PROGRESSION  \nHarmony should support the COMPOSITION’S narrative, exhibiting control of CONSONANCE, DISSONANCE, and COLOR. Ratings reward fresh chord choices, logical voice-leading, and effective use of MODULATION or MODE mixture. A 5 reveals a personal harmonic signature; a 1 relies on worn-out I–V–VI–IV loops with no internal logic.  \n***\nCRITERION 3: RHYTHMIC VITALITY & TEXTURAL VARIETY  \nThis STANDARD examines how RHYTHM generates forward motion and how TEXTURE sustains interest. Syncopation, meter shifts, and layered grooves earn higher marks when they serve expressive goals. A 5 composition balances propulsive energy with breathing space; a 1 stagnates in unvarying patterns that fatigue the listener.  \n***\nCRITERION 4: FORM AND DEVELOPMENT  \nEffective STRUCTURE deploys EXPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT, and RECAPITULATION (or comparable sections) with cogent proportion and narrative arc. Judges look for seamless transitions, climactic pacing, and economical reuse of material. A 5 form feels inevitable yet surprising; a 1 rambles or ends abruptly without satisfying closure.  \n***\nCRITERION 5: INSTRUMENTATION & PRESENTATION  \nThe RUBRIC expects idiomatic writing for chosen instruments or digital media, including accurate ranges, articulations, and dynamic markings. Notation must be PERFORMANCE-ready; MIDI realizations should demonstrate MIX clarity and BALANCE.

Authorship & Intent (5 min)\n   • Damien Chazelle’s filmography headset: Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench → Whiplash → First Man.  \n   • Overarching obsession: cost of perfection.  \n   • Quick timeline graphic: Chazelle at 31 = youngest Best Director winner → parallels Mia & Sebastian’s “young genius” theme.\n\n5.

Structure as Recursive Spiral (5 min)\n   • Handout “5-Season” diagram:  \n     Winter (meeting) → Spring (infatuation) → Summer (creative bloom) → Fall (first rupture) → Winter (five years later).  \n   • Students guess where the “epilogue” fantasy fits: denial, alternate universe, or cathartic purge?\n\n8. Ending Moral Dilemma Debate (12 min)\n   • Prompt: “Is the film romantic or cynical?”  \n   • Divide class into Team Romantic (dream achieved, smile exchanged) vs. Team Cynical (love lost).  \n   • 4-min prep evidence (camera angles, lyrics, color shift, Jazz history).  \n   • 4-min rapid debate.  \n   • Professor synthesis: Hollywood endings evolve; ambivalence is the new “happy.”\n\n9.

In your response, the word disappointed should appear at least 2 times, and at least six section should be highlighted with markdown,  i.e *banana peel*.", "response": "Slipping Into Science: The Wild Biology of a *Banana Peel*  \n\nIntroduction – Why You’re Already Disappointed  \nYou clicked expecting a few slapstick jokes and maybe a punch-line about Mario Kart. Instead, you’re getting chlorophyll breakdown pathways, fungal sex lives, and the existential dread of a ripening fruit. Buckle up; the *banana peel* is about to disappoint you in ways you never knew possible.\n\n1. *The Peel That Launched a Thousand Slapstick Gags*  \nBack in 1915, filmmakers discovered that a *banana peel* on grey pavement reads as “instant laughter” even in black-and-white. What they didn’t know was that the yellow skin is literally engineered by the plant to become a self-lubricating biosled. As pectin middle-lamella dissolve, shear forces drop below 0.2—exactly the coefficient of friction that makes your feet fly higher than your dignity. Physics teachers call it “low µ”; vaudeville called it Tuesday night.\n\n2. *Chlorophyll’s Dramatic Exit*  \nInside every green *banana peel* chlorophyll is living its best life—until ethylene gas whispers, “You’re cancelled.” The pigment disassembles like a boy-band after the first Grammy loss, revealing carotenoids that have been waiting backstage the whole time. If chlorophyll had feelings, it would be disappointed to learn its entire job was just to keep the peel looking good until the carotenoids could arrive fashionably late.\n\n3. *The Quiet Tantrum of Latex Vessels*  \nCut a fresh *banana peel* and tiny latex tubes bleed a sticky white tantrum. This milky goo is the plant’s version of pepper spray, packed with antifungal chitinases and the same enzyme that makes your shoe rubbery. Evolutionarily speaking, it’s a “do not eat me” bracelet. The bracelet fails spectacularly once we invent sneakers and slapstick comedy.\n\n4. *Fungal Love Hotels*  \nAfter rejection by humans, the *banana peel* becomes a singles bar for mold. Spores land, form appressoria (tiny fungal foot-stompers), and drill into peel cells like oil prospectors. Within 48 h you’ve got a nightclub of Rhizopus stolonifer popping zygospores like champagne corks. The fruit regrets nothing; the peel, however, is quietly disappointed that its afterlife involves being a honeymoon suite for saprophytes.\n\n5. *The Great Potassium Heist*  \nA medium *banana peel* hides ~400 mg of potassium, enough to run a snail-sized ticker tape parade for electrolytes. Unfortunately, 400 mg is also the exact amount your body needs to pretend the vending-machine chips “balanced themselves out.” moral: next time someone calls the peel trash, remind them it’s basically a free sports drink wearing yellow Spanx.\n\n6. *Compost Teas & Existential Crisis*  \nGarden gurus insist you steep *banana peel* in water for “compost tea,” promising blooms bigger than your carbon footprint. What they don’t mention is that steeping releases a bouquet of aromatic aldehydes that smell like regret mixed with wet cardboard. Your roses will flourish, but your kitchen will smell like a disappointed banana that read too much Kierkegaard.\n\nConclusion – Embrace the Slide  \nThe next time you step on a rogue *banana peel*, remember: you’re not just falling, you’re participating in a 100-million-year-old plot between fruit, fungus, and physics. Sure, your ego will be bruised, your latte airborne, and your TikTok viewers howling—but deep down, the peel is proud. It finally achieved its evolutionary purpose: turning dignity into horizontal velocity. And if that doesn’t make you feel better, at least be grateful you weren’t the chlorophyll—now THAT guy has a right to be disappointed.", "cost": 0.0016764999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "disappointed", "frequency": 2}, {"num_highlights": 6}], "result": true}

Define the problem in a single sentence that a 12-year-old could repeat. Strip away jargon until only the human stake remains: a lake that will dry, a child who will miss school, a species about to blink out. Write that sentence on a sticky note and keep it visible for the rest of the campaign; it is your compass.\n\nSection 2  \nPeople give to people, not to issues. Find the one story that makes the statistics breathe. Maybe it is a father who walks 14 miles for radiation treatment, or a beekeeper whose hives collapsed the same week her grand-daughter was born. Record 30 seconds of that person speaking in their own voice; pair it with one unfiltered photo. Post it without overlays or logos on day one. Let the audience meet them before they ever meet your brand.\n\nSection 3  \nAwareness is not a single post; it is a breadcrumb trail. Map eight micro-moments across four weeks: a surprise fact on Monday, a 15-second reel Wednesday, a handwritten letter screenshot Friday, a live Q&A the following Tuesday.

Momentum compounds when the exit door is never more than two thumb-scrolls away.\n\nSection 4  \nOffline is the cheat code. Reserve one hour every Saturday to stand where foot traffic is high but agendas are low: farmers’ markets, basketball tournaments, laundromats.

Not metaphorical ones—actual, breathing creatures with wings of parchment and ink. They fluttered from her lips each dawn, carrying her secrets to the wind.\n\nThis was troubling, as secrets are the currency of royalty.\n\nHer father, King Ferdinand the Melancholy, had wept himself into a statue since his queen died birthing their daughter. The court physicians said his tears calcified his heart first, then his skin. Now he stood in the rose garden, a marble monument to grief, with moss growing where his mustache once twitched. Only on nights when the roses bloomed backwards—petals retreating into buds—did his stone eyes weep fresh tears that sounded like wind chimes.\n\nSeraphina learned to swallow her words. She kept scrolls in her cheeks like a hamster, until her jaw ached with unspoken stories. But one autumn equinox, a dragon arrived.\n\nHe was not the dragon of nursery tales—no smoke or sulfur or princess-hunger. Scaleshine (for that was his name, though humans could only pronounce it by gargling starlight) had feathers instead of spikes, each plume a different decade of autumn. When he perched on the castle's broken observatory dome, his wings folded like a book closing, and Seraphina saw her mother's eyes reflected in his bronze claws.\n\n\"I've come for the lullaby,\" Scaleshine rumbled, though the sound was more like a lute being tuned by rain. \"The one your mother sang to the roses. They've forgotten how to sleep.\"\n\nSeraphina's words burst from her throat as monarch butterflies, their wings spelling: *My mother is dead. The roses obey no one.*\n\nThe dragon tilted his head. \"Death is a door, not a wall,\" he replied, his breath smelling of cardamom and distant winters. \"But doors require keys. Your voice is mercury—I can shape it into a key.\"\n\nThat night, they made a bargain. Scaleshine would teach her to forge her words into keys; she would help him find the lost lullaby. But each key would cost a memory. The dragon's feathers rustled with anticipation, shedding years like dandruff.\n\nFirst, she gave up the memory of her mother's laughter. The key that emerged was brass, warm as fresh bread. It unlocked the greenhouse where the roses grew upside-down, roots tangling like drunken philosophers. But the lullaby wasn't there—only her father's statue, weeping marigolds.\n\nSecond, she surrendered the memory of her first kiss (a stable boy who'd tasted of hay and apologies). The iron key that followed opened the library's shadow, where books wrote themselves in languages that expired upon pronunciation. Still, no lullaby.\n\nBy the seventh key, Seraphina had forgotten her own reflection. The final key was made of nothing—her mother's name, spoken until it became a hole in the air. When she inserted it into Scaleshine's chest, where a heart should be, the dragon split open like a ripe fig.\n\nInside was not fire, but a nursery. A smaller dragon—no bigger than a teacup—curled around a music box. Its scales were her mother's laughter, its wings her father's pre-grief smile. The lullaby poured out, not as sound but as weather: snow that tasted of breastmilk, wind that hummed lullabies in the key of unborn children.\n\n\"The roses were never meant to sleep,\" the baby dragon replied in Seraphina's mother's voice. \"They were learning to dream awake.\"\n\nSeraphina understood. She pressed her lips to the baby dragon's forehead and inhaled. The butterflies returned, but now they carried memories back—her mother's laughter landing on her tongue like cinnamon. Her father's statue cracked, revealing not stone but a man wrapped in marble-colored bandages, his eyes blinking awake.\n\nScaleshine's body dissolved into autumn itself, settling over the kingdom like a blanket. Where his feathers fell, time ran backwards only far enough—roses remembered how to close at night without dying, her father learned to cry liquid tears again, and Seraphina...\n\nSeraphina kept the ability to speak keys, but now she used them differently. Each year, on the equinox, she unlocks the sky just enough for her mother's laughter to rain down as song. The baby dragon—her sibling, really—grows a little each year, its scales shifting through the seasons of their shared childhood.\n\nAnd if you visit Verdantia during the hour between owl and rooster, you might see them: a princess and a dragon, planting memories like bulbs in the garden. Some grow into new stories. Others into doors that open only outward, never closing what was loved behind them.\n\nThe roses, meanwhile, have learned to dream with their eyes open. Their petals hold the pattern of a dragon's feather and a queen's last lullaby, which sounds—when the wind is right—like a key turning in a lock that was never meant to keep anything out.\n\nOr in.\n\n*\"Replied\" count: 2*", "cost": 0.0022485, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "replied", "frequency": 2}], "result": true}

Separate the essay and the poem with 6 asterisk symbols: ******\nIn other words, your response should have the following form:\n[essay]\n******\n[poem]", "response": "Essay\n\nBenjamin Franklin was born on January 17, 1706, in a modest Boston house that smelled of tallow and ink. The tenth son of a soap-boiler, he learned early that candles and words could both illuminate. Apprenticed to his brother James at twelve, he devoured discarded pamphlets the way other boys stole peaches, and he taught himself to imitate Addison’s prose until his own sentences crackled. When James refused to let the adolescent write for The New-England Courant, Ben slipped essays under the door under the pseudonym “Silence Dogood,” proving that silence, properly managed, can speak louder than authority.\n\nAt seventeen he fled southward, bedraggled and broke, the Atlantic wind stitching salt into his coat. Philadelphia in 1723 was a muddy chessboard of Quakers, alehouses, and ambition; Franklin would soon become its most indefatigable king. He clerked, printed, drank little, saved pennies, and reinvented penny-saving, founding the Library Company in 1731 so that knowledge could circulate like currency. Poor Richard’s Almanack (1732) offered farmers maxims as tart as cider vinegar—“A penny saved is a penny earned”—and sold ten thousand copies a year, turning proverb into profit. By thirty he had enough print shops, paper mills, and rental properties to retire from trade, yet retirement merely freed his curiosity to sprint.\n\nScience was next. The same hand that set type pulled lightning from the sky. His kite experiment of 1752—equal parts theater and theology—showed that heaven’s fire was ordinary electricity, thereby demoting Zeus to a static spark. The lightning rod tamed storms, but Franklin tamed fear itself, arguing that safety lay not in prayer alone but in pointed metal and grounded reason. He invented bifocals so his eyes could read both near and far, a parable for his mind. He charted the Gulf Stream, reduced postal delivery times, and toyed with phonetics, leaving the Gulf Stream and the English language both more navigable.\n\nPolitics followed science the way dusk follows day. Albany Plan of Union (1754): “Join, or Die”—the colonies’ first rattlesnake cartoon and first sketch of nationhood. In London he argued before the Privy Council while wearing a homespun suit, proving that one can dress humility like armor. Stamp Act repealed, he returned home to find Boston harbor tea-dark and Massachusetts angry; at sixty-nine he helped edit Jefferson’s thunderbolts into the Declaration of Independence, smoothing the young man’s youthful lightning into sustained fire. Then to Paris, where he traded his beaver cap for Versailles silk, convinced France that republicanism could be chic, and secured the loans that kept Washington’s army from evaporating. The treaty of 1783 bore his signature, sealing the United States like an envelope addressed to the future.\n\nYet Franklin’s last act was the most radical: he helped invent the United States Constitution, then urged it to abolish slavery, gifting his dying breath to a cause the document had betrayed. In 1790, wracked by pleurisy, he rose in the Pennsylvania Abolition Society to petition Congress: “Mankind are one community.” He died April 17, 1790, aged eighty-four, his funeral attended by an estimated twenty thousand Philadelphians—black and white—who followed the cortege through rain-slick streets as if the city itself were one giant printing press, ink still wet with his life. He left America the Enlightenment’s greatest invention: a citizen who proved that a man might be born without title, coin, or latitude, yet still conduct himself like a republic of one, sparks flying upward.\n\n******\nPoem\n\nInk-stained Boston boy,  \nyou set type like planting stars,  \nthen flew a kite so thunder  \nwould teach you its true name.  \n\nPrinter, punster, lightning-rod,  \nyou stitched colonies into thought,  \nbent lenses so eyes could read  \nboth almanac and horizon.  \n\nIn Paris you wore humility  \ntailored into silk persuasion,  \nsigned storms into treaties,  \nand still petitioned to free  \nthe storm inside another man.  \n\nWhen your eighty-fourth candle guttered,  \nthe city followed your coffin  \nthrough wet April dark,  \neach footstep a lowercase letter  \nstill glowing on the composing stone  \nof the republic you never stopped setting.", "cost": 0.001873, "instruction_id_list": ["combination:two_responses"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

At the end of your response, please explicitly add a note starting with \"P.S.\"", "response": "How to write a good Chinese poem (today, in any style you like)\n\n1. Start from an image, not a moral  \nChinese poetry is rooted in the “scene–feeling” (景–情) structure: let the outer world trigger the inner, then stop. Pick one precise, sensuous image—frost on a bamboo leaf, a train-station announcement half lost in rain, the way your grandmother’s plastic comb cracked in last winter’s cold. The smaller, the sharper.\n\n2. Choose your “I” carefully  \nClassical shi and ci seldom say “I love” or “I suffer”; the persona is implied through action and object. Even in free verse, a Chinese reader flinches at too much direct confession. Let the self dissolve into the scene: instead of “I feel lonely,” write “I stir the tea until the leaves stand upright, still no second cup.”\n\n3. Work with tones, even if you ignore tone patterns  \nMandarin has four plus neutral; Cantonese six plus three. Read every candidate line aloud slowly; if the mouth has to jump awkwardly, rewrite. The ear should skate, not stumble. (This is the last, living residue of regulated-tone prosody.)\n\n4. Three handles for compression  \n- Drop subjects and conjunctions: “Rain. Late bus. Someone’s lost / umbrella opens itself on the asphalt.”  \n- One verb can do two jobs: “灯照老了墙” (“The lamp ages the wall with its light”).  \n- Prefer a noun that already carries time inside it: “railway clock,” “scratch-off ticket,” “abacus.”\n\n5. Insert a historical echo, but twist it  \nQuote, mis-quote, or simply summon a Tang line—then land it in subway LED light. The short circuit between past and present is what gives a modern Chinese poem its voltage.\n\n6. Let the last line be a door, not a summary  \nIt should open onto white space. The reader is co-author; give him or her one cold star, one unopened envelope, one “perhaps” to walk home with.\n\n7. Revise by cutting vertically, not horizontally  \nClassical poets spoke of “lifting the skin to see the bones.” After every draft, remove one entire layer of wording; keep the vertical axis—breath, rhythm, implied narrative—intact. When you can no longer remove anything without the poem collapsing, it is done.\n\nExample (modern free-verse, bilingual skeleton)\n\n夜雨刮平了废旧操场的塑料椅  \n我停步，像一首被删去的  \n七言——  \n口袋里硬币  \n和铁网一样  \n轻\n\nNight rain irons the plastic chairs of the abandoned playground  \nI halt, like a deleted  \nseven-syllable line—  \ncoins in the pocket  \nas light  \nas the wire fence\n\nP.S. Good Chinese poetry is rarely written while thinking “I am writing a Chinese poem.” Write the moment; let the language decide whether it wants to be Chinese, and trust that your tongue already remembers more dynasties than you have years.", "cost": 0.0012915, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:postscript"], "kwargs": [{"postscript_marker": "P.S."}], "result": true}

{"id": 179, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "A filmmaker is trying to get financing for a film about the history of the Internet. Write an essay to be used in the proposal to potential investors. The essay should be at least 50 sentences long.", "response": "The Internet is not a single invention but a restless, ever-spreading organism that has re-wired the human nervous system in less than two human generations, and the film we propose will be the first panoramic, character-driven cinematic journey to trace that mutation from its secret Cold-War birth to the moment it slipped inside every pocket on Earth.  Investors are rightfully fatigued by technology documentaries that feel like elongated TED talks, but our film will behave like a thriller, shot on 35 mm and IMAX, scored by an Oscar-winning composer, anchored by movie-star performances portraying the real architects of the network age, and released at a cultural moment when the metaverse, AI and Web3 have made “the Internet” feel both omnipotent and terrifyingly fragile.  The global box-office for premium documentaries has grown 340 % in the last decade, and the 2021 streaming wars have proven that IP with built-in educational cachet and four-quadrant appeal commands eight-figure acquisition prices; a film that finally treats the Internet’s saga like “The Social Network” meets “Apollo 13” is poised to become the definitive reference for every civics class, coding boot-camp and board-room orientation from Silicon Valley to Shenzhen.  We open in October 1969 at UCLA, in a windowless room lit by cigarette smoke and punch-card printers, where a 21-year-old grad student named Charley Kline attempts to log into a machine 350 miles away and crashes the world’s first networked computer after typing the letter “G,” an invisible stumble that will one day snowball into five billion daily searches on Google.  From that Chekhovian misfire we sprint, decade by decade, across three intersecting plotlines: the idealistic scientists who believed knowledge should be free, the Pentagon tacticians who funded their dreams to survive nuclear holocaust, and the teenage outsiders who turned military code into the first electronic marketplaces of sex, drugs and punk music.  Each act is anchored by a propulsive set-piece—the first router arrives in a crate marked “Handle like eggs,” a 1986 hacker convention erupts into an FBI raid, a 1995 IPO scribbles a millionaire on every napkin in a California Pizza Kitchen—so that abstruse protocols become palpable stakes.  Our ensemble cast will be introduced documentary-style in the present day, gray-haired and reflective, then re-incarnated by A-list actors in archival, 16-mm flashbacks that splice verité cinematography with rotoscopic animation to visualize packets of data zooming under the ocean floor like glowing schools of digital fish.  The film’s spine is a question every viewer already feels in their phantom thumb-scroll ache: did we build a library for humanity or a surveillance machine that is slowly rewiring our capacity to remain human?  By refusing to pick a side too soon, we create the same suspense that powered “The Wire”: the system itself is the protagonist, and every character is simultaneously perpetrator and victim.  Financially, the project is de-risked by a pre-sell strategy that treats each geographic territory as a co-producer: CERN has offered unprecedented access to the original NeXT computer on which the World Wide Web was written, the Internet Archive has cleared 400 TB of never-before-seen 4K footage, and the governments of Estonia and South Korea have pledged soft-money rebates in exchange for local units that showcase how tiny nations leapt from agrarian poverty to digital powerhouses in a single generation.  We budget the film at USD 18 million, a midpoint between the 40,000-interview oral-history price tag and the 200-million-dollar VFX spectacles that rarely leave consumers talking afterwards; our model is “Free Solo,” which returned 18× cash-on-cash by keeping production lean and post-sale windows wide.  Revenue projections conservative-streaming PVOD, international broadcast, IMAX museum run, university perpetual license and a 10-year STEM curriculum package—forecast a 47 % IRR over five years, un-amplified by NFT collectibles and a companion podcast already ranked #4 on technology charts in pre-production.  The pitch deck’s secret weapon is data: we commissioned a Harris Poll that shows 82 % of 18-34-year-olds claim they would “definitely” watch a premium film explaining how the Internet began, while 71 % of parents say they would pay an educational surcharge if classroom materials aligned with national science standards, a dual revenue stream unseen since “March of the Penguins.”  Compared with biopics of fading rock stars, our subject cannot age out or cancel-tweet overnight; the Internet is the fastest-growing religious belief system on Earth, and its origin story only becomes more mythic as fiber and code recede into utility.  Our director, Lucia Chen, arrived in Hollywood after a PhD in particle physics and an Emmy for the Netflix mini-series “Quantum Family,” giving her rare fluency to translate whiteboard equations into elegant visual stakes while protecting the narrative from tech-bro triumphalism.  The cinematographer, Hoyte van der Merwe, who shot 40 % of “Gravity” pick-ups, has designed a custom 18-mm lens that can photograph electrons moving through copper cable as shimmering star-fields, turning the inside of a laptop into a cosmic event.  Casting is already in conversation with Daniel Kaluuya to play a young Vint Cerf, Zendaya as Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler who ran the pre-Google naming registry on a donated PDP-10, and Dev Patel as Sri Narayana, the unsung Bangalore student who wrote the first indigenous-language browser plugin and cracked open a continent.  These names test 94 % positive awareness across three continents and carry social-media footprints that exceed the combined annual marketing budget of most indie labels, translating into first-dollar leverage on every platform.  Our legal team has cleared the entire labyrinth of ARPANET government footage under the 2021 declassification wave, secured life-rights for twelve living elders, and negotiated Errors & Omissions insurance that already satisfied Netflix’s compliance committee, removing the last green-light obstacle that buried prior attempts.  The soundtrack is being composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir, who will sample the actual whirr and hum of vintage mainframes at the Computer History Museum, converting machinery into a living orchestra whose leitmotif mutates from analog sine waves to 8-bit arpeggios to dubstep as the narrative approaches the present, an aural mirror of technological adolescence.  Marketing partners include Mozilla, which will open the film on 200 million browsers as a voluntary pre-roll takeover day-and-date with theatrical release; the Wikimedia Foundation, which is co-hosting a 24-hour global edit-a-thon timed to premiere weekend, guaranteeing earned media valued at 30M impressions without spend.  The merchandise pipeline is not Funko pops but educational artifacts: a build-it-yourself enigma-colored router kit for middle-schoolers, a STEM board game that teaches packet-switching, and an NFT marketplace where collectors can own tokenized fractions of the first “Interface Message Processor,” the 1969 router that is the Internet’s equivalent of the Wright Flyer, predicted to fetch seven figures at auction and to be shared pro-rata with equity investors.  Distribution strategy is platform-agnostic but release-order obsessive: we launch on 100 IMAX screens to establish event status, vault for 45 days to create FOMO, then cascade to premium VOD at USD 19.99 during back-to-school season when libraries upgrade digital catalogs, finally landing on a major streamer that has already tabled a non-exclusive 8-figure offer but wishes to remain unnamed until Cannes.  Ancillary rights include a coffee-table book printed on seeded paper that can be planted to grow wildflowers coded with URLs of bonus content, an experiential museum exhibit currently booked for ten cities with break-even guaranteed by ticket pre-sales, and a curriculum deal with College Board that embeds 12 derived shorts inside the AP Computer Science exam for the next decade, each placement yielding per-student royalties.  The film’s very production is a proof-of-concept of open culture: all dailies will be encrypted on the blockchain with timestamped access keys released to patrons who stake development tokens, creating an immutable “making-of” that can be monetized as its own docu-series long after the wrap party.  ESG metrics are formidable: remote-rendered VFX will run on Google Cloud regions committed to 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030; union crews will be transported via electric shuttles; and 1 % of net profits will endow a fellowship for female open-source developers, ensuring the story’s next chapter is less monochrome than its first.  Competitive moats are time-based: as Moore’s law slows, the living witnesses of the pre-browser era diminish; every twelve-month delay raises clearance budgets an estimated 9 % and lowers first-mover novelty, an inverse incentive for investors to accelerate rather than hesitate.  The cultural timeliness is uncanny: the U.S. Congress is debating a “Digital Bill of Rights,” the EU just voted to force interoperability, and India announced 600 million new rural connections; whoever owns the emotional narrative of “how we got here” will frame the regulatory future, and this film can be that narrative.  Investment tiers are carved like bandwidth: Executive Producers at USD 2 million receive an IMAX end-credit billboard plus 5 % of first-dollar gross; Co-Producers at USD 500 k secure a regional premiere naming right; crowd-equity shares begin at USD 100 with tokenized screen credit searchable on IMDb, democratizing the same grassroots energy that built Wikipedia. Exit windows are sequenced: 18-month soft-valuation based on international pre-sales currently at USD 9.4 million, 36-month hard-valuation pegged to streaming benchmarks where comparable titles such as “The Great Hack” traded at 4.3× revenue, and a 60-month strategic option for catalog sale to a tech giant seeking legacy content under ASC 350 goodwill amortization.  The biggest risk is not technological obsolescence but narrative indigestion, solved by our story department’s rule: if a grandmother in 1970 Kolkata cannot understand the stakes in one sentence, the scene is cut, ensuring the final 128-minute cut is lean, propulsive, and universal.  We commissioned neurological tests that show galvanic skin response spikes 23 % higher when viewers watch our animatic of the first email being sent versus watching a car chase in “Fast & Furious”; human curiosity is the final special effect, and we have it in unlimited render.  The film ends in a Chilean observatory where 8-year-old school-children use a crusty 1990s webcam to wave at the audience, reminding us that the Internet is still only 0.2 % of Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history, a blink in which we chose to connect before we fully understood the cost, and inviting viewers to finance this cautionary love letter so the next chapter can be more conscious than the last.  By signing this term-sheet, investors will not merely fund a movie; they will mint the definitive cultural firmware upgrade, a story that future coders, senators, and grandparents will stream before they vote, code, or click the next yes, which means the return on equity is also a return on the commons we all share.  In short, the history of the Internet is the only franchise that never stops expanding its own theatrical universe every nanosecond of every day, and for the first time, the gatekeeping rights to that story are open to partners who can read the writing on the wall—because it is literally written on every wall with light, pixels, and the same luminous dust that once spelled “LO” on a cracked blue terminal in 1969, still asking us, in every packet, to look.", "cost": 0.004959000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 50}], "result": false}

Eyewitnesses report the aliens arrived aboard glittery, heart-shaped spacecraft that smell faintly of pineapple pizza and regret. Within minutes, they began demanding to see “Earth’s manager,” insisting our planet’s Yelp rating was “weefully inadequate.” Traffic apps everywhere crashed under the weight of drivers uploading dash-cam footage hashtagged #ProbeMyBrakeLights.\n\nPresident Skipper T. Wombat, elected last year on a platform of free ice cream and mandatory disco Fridays, addressed the planet from an underground bunker hastily wallpapered with motivational cat posters. “My fellow Earthicans,” he declared, donning a tinfoil sombrero for protection, “I have personally negotiated a peace treaty exchanging all of our cat videos for their advanced technology—specifically, a microwave that also does taxes.” When informed the aliens communicate exclusively through interpretive dance, the President responded by break-dancing the National Anthem, thereby accidentally declaring war on three neighboring galaxies.\n\nThe invaders’ first act of hostility was converting every Starbucks into elaborate karaoke bars that serve only lukewarm oatmeal. Customers attempting to order lattes are instead serenaded by six-tentacled baristas performing “Total Eclipse of the Heart” while laser-light spelling errors flash overhead. Yelp reviews have plummeted to negative five stars, prompting the aliens to leave disappointed one-star replies: “Not enough interpretive dance, too much interpretive despair.”\n\nIn retaliation, Earth’s military forces launched the ultimate weapon: a 24-hour loop of elevator music fused with recordings of dentists’ drills. The extraterrestrials, mistaking the sonic assault for an invitation to a rave, immediately formed conga lines and began trading glow-stick antennae for human socks, which they wear as fashionable neckties. Peace talks stalled when translators realized the aliens thought “surrender” meant “please send more memes.”\n\nBy Thursday, both sides agreed to a ceasefire after discovering mutual adoration of reality TV. A joint committee will produce a new series titled “Keeping Up with the Kuiper Belt,” featuring alien housewives throwing zero-gravity wine at each other while Earth’s bravest astronauts compete to redecorate their spacecraft in shabby-chic nebula patterns. Ratings are expected to exceed the moon landing, provided the aliens stop trying to photocopy their own tentacles for souvenirs.\n\nAs of press time, the aliens have announced their impending departure, citing “creative differences” and an overwhelming desire to visit a planet with better snacks. They leave behind only unpaid parking tickets, 42,000 tons of glitter, and a single post-it note reading, “You’re welcome for the oatmeal, call us never.” Humanity breathes a sigh of relief, vowing never again to elect a president who break-dances international treaties, while secretly hoping the spin-off series gets picked up for season two.", "cost": 0.001323, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "president", "num_paragraphs": 6, "nth_paragraph": 2}], "result": false}

*distant raid boss dialogue*, filters through the door: “Dinner’s getting cold,” and I roll critical failure on filial piety.  \nCons: The *ache nesting between my scapulas* is learning to pronounce

grass outside is *rendered at low resolution*, and I no longer trust textures I cannot strafe around.  \n\nIV.  \nStill, I *harvest friendships* across continents, send heart emojis that pulse truer

memories *glitch yet endure*, hanging in the cloud like *digital constellations* guiding night-shift insomniacs.  \nBut somewhere between update 2.3 and patch 5.7, *my offline body* became a

strips.  \nIn the *shared campfire of forums*, we trade cautionary tales: the friend who forgot to graduate, the uncle who lost his retina to a forty-hour mobile marathon.  \nWe *wrap these stories in

clouds, the neighbor’s dog barking in uncompressed 96 kHz.  \nI *remember boredom*, that vintage mini-boss, and how it once forged entire summers of sidewalk chalk and bicycle empires before achievements were invented.  \nI *speedrun self-reflection*, five minutes of journaling before the丝绒darkness of sleep spawns in.  \n\nXI.  \nPros: I *crowd-source courage*, queue solo for dungeons until the fear of strangers thins into a *party of comrades* who teach me accent jokes.  \nPros: I *study architecture* by glitch-walking out of bounds, discovering the *wireframe backsides* of castles that were never meant to be seen.  \nPros: I *binge on mythology* rewritten in hex code, learning that every dragon is just a *bug report* about gravity someone forgot to patch.  \nCons: The *screen-door effect* of VR replaces my night vision; when I remove the headset, reality feels *low-polygon*, edges jaggy with uncanny aliasing.  \nCons: I *pirate time*, torrent entire weekends until Monday arrives corrupted, missing seeders for motivation.  \n\nXII.  \nI *patch sleep hygiene*, install blue-light filters that tint the world sepia like a *retro platformer* nobody asked to remaster.  \nI *grind gratitude*, whisper thanks to every cashier as if NPC dialogues could unlock hidden romance routes.  \nBut the *micro-transactions of energy* still drain me, five bucks worth of stamina for every shower, every load of laundry another *season pass*.  \n\nXIII.  \nPros: I *map reading habits* to quest logs, turning pages like hidden switches that open *new chambers of vocabulary*.  \nPros: I *master inventory Tetris*, packing suitcases with spatial logic that would make Russian astronauts weep in admiration.  \nPros: I *record evidence of wonder*, capture thirty-second clips of aurora glitches inside indie titles, later replaying them to *re-enchant commuter trains*.  \nCons: My *social credit score* drops when I cancel plans, blaming “server maintenance” for the loneliness I haven’t debugged yet.  \nCons: I *farm FOMO*, harvesting tweets about exclusive skins until my self-worth is *nerfed* by pixels I’ll never equip.  \n\nXIV.  \nI *schedule respites*, Sabbath squares on the calendar labeled “no controllers,” forcing myself to *grind life* instead.  \nI *notice haptics*: wind is an *HD rumble* against cheeks, rain a percussive feedback loop teaching skin its own *tactile language*.  \nYet the *withdrawal debuff* lingers, an itch in the phantom limb where the mouse used to rest, craving the *click of criticality*.  \n\nXV.  \nPros: I *archive resilience*, save scumming through setbacks, internalizing that every mistake can be *previewed and rewinded* if learned from publicly.  \nPros: I *unlock empathy* by role-playing the antagonist, discovering that every villain was once a *protagonist with corrupted data*.  \nPros: I *forge long-distance love*, maintaining a romance across three time zones using co-op puzzles as *care packages of coordination*.

{"id": 1834, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "I asked a friend about how to remove rust from my bike chain. He told me to pour coke on it and then scrub it with a steel wool. Is this a good way to remove rust? Respond with at least 20 sentences and have more than 4 words be in all capital letters.", "response": "Using COKE to dissolve rust is one of those popular DIY hacks you see on social media, but it is only marginally effective and it can create NEW problems for your bicycle. The phosphoric acid in the soda does indeed convert a thin layer of reddish iron oxide into a more stable black compound, yet the concentration is LOW, the reaction is SLOW, and you will still be left with pits and rough metal once the brown crust is gone. Steel wool seems tough enough to scour anything, yet on a bike chain it acts like 100 tiny SANDPAPERS that scratch away the factory chrome or nickel plating; once that thin SKIN is gone the underlying steel is exposed and it will flash-rust within hours, sometimes before you even finish your ride. Every time you push a VALVE of abrasive wool across an outer plate you are also forcing microscopic grit INTO the rollers and pins where grease normally lives; afterwards the chain will sound like GRINDING coffee beans even if you drown it in fresh lube. Coke is also about ten percent SUGAR, and once the watery part evaporates you are left with a STICKY film that attracts road grit like syrup on a picnic table; that combo turns into an impressively efficient PASTE that wears your gears down twice as fast as plain rust ever would. Professional mechanics almost never use soda because the cost of replacing a ruined cassette is far higher than the cost of doing the job properly in the first place. A far BETTER approach is to buy a five-dollar spray can of Evapo-Rust or a citrus-based de-oxidizer from the hardware store; these products CHELATE the iron oxide instead of converting it, lifting the rust away while leaving good metal and protective plating untouched. After you remove the chain with a ZONKING breaker tool (or quick-link pliers if your model is SRAM, KMC, Shimano 12-speed, etc.) you drop it into a plastic BOTTLE half full of the remover, give it a 20-minute shake, rinse with water, dry with compressed air or a HAIR dryer set to LOW, and then apply a proper wet or dry lube depending on your climate. If the corrosion is mild you can sometimes get away with leaving the chain ON the bike: spray the rusted links, let it soak, spin the cranks backward while you BRUSH with an old toothbrush, wipe off the black slurry with a lint-free rag, relube, and ride. The moment you see orange-brown DRIBBLES on the rag you know the factory coating has already been compromised; at that point you should either accept shorter chain life or buy a fresh one before your cassette and chainrings start wearing into shark-fin shapes. Prevention is cheaper than cure, so after every wet ride you dab the chain with a dry rag, spin the pedals backwards, and let capillary action wick the water out of the rollers; then apply a SINGLE drop of lube on each roller, wait five minutes, and wipe off the excess so the outside stays almost dry to the touch. Another TRICK is to keep a cheap plastic CLAMP-on chain scrubber in your kit; every two weeks you fill it with a spoon of degreaser, clamp it on, spin for 30 seconds, rinse, dry, and you have a factory-clean drivetrain without ever touching steel wool. Some riders swear by ultrasonic cleaners, which vibrate at 40 kHz and dislodge rust from the nooks between pins and bushings; these are GREAT if you already own one for jewelry or carburetors, but they are overkill for the average cyclist who just wants to get to work without squeaks. Remember that a modern chain is a HYPER-engineered consumable: even under best conditions it elongates by 0.5 percent every 2,000–3,000 km, so measuring with a gauge every month and replacing BEFORE it hits 0.75 percent will save your expensive cassette and chainrings from turning into Expensive Scrap. In short, COKE and STEEL WOOL can remove some BROWN crust, yet the downsides are STICKY residue, scratched plating, embedded grit, and faster wear; spend the extra ten minutes on a proper de-ruster and you will ride quieter, shift smoother, and keep money in your wallet instead of in your shop’s cash register.", "cost": 0.0018429999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 20}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 5}], "result": false}

Use IRS Form 1040 as your main worksheet, entering wages, interest, dividends, and any self-employment income on the appropriate lines. Subtract either the standard deduction or your itemized total (Schedule A) to arrive at taxable income, then apply the progressive tax brackets to determine the raw tax owed. Don’t forget to subtract any non-refundable credits (like the Child Tax Credit or education credits) and add self-employment tax if applicable; the final number is what you must pay or what will be refunded.\n\n***\n\nOnce you calculate the bottom-line tax, decide how you want to file. Most taxpayers e-file through IRS Free File or commercial software, which walks you through interview questions and transmits the return directly to the IRS and state revenue department in minutes; you’ll receive an electronic acknowledgment within 24 hours. If you prefer paper, print the completed 1040, attach W-2 copies and any schedules (such as Schedule C for business or Schedule D for capital gains), and mail to the correct IRS service center via certified mail before the April deadline. Simultaneously file your state return—many states accept the federal data automatically—and choose whether to pay any balance due by direct debit, credit card (with a fee), or check; remember that an extension to file is not an extension to pay, so estimate and remit at least 90 % of the expected tax to avoid penalties.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the tax cycle is simply calculate, file, and pay (or receive a refund), but each step has detail you must not overlook: keep supporting documents for at least three years, reconcile advance Child Tax Credit or Premium Tax Credit amounts, and adjust withholding or quarterly estimates so next April’s surprise is minimal. If your financial life grows complex—rental property, crypto trading, or large charitable transfers—consider hiring a CPA or Enrolled Agent once the cost outweighs the convenience of software.

Your response should contain at least 30 sentences and exactly 2 bullet points. Also, it must contain at least 8 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]. Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", "response": "The comparative power of wizards versus sorcerers is one of the most enduring debates in arcane circles, often raised during late-night sessions at taverns such as [tavern name] where apprentices gather to argue over watered-down [drink name]. Those who claim that wizards are inherently superior frequently cite the grueling discipline required to master the eight schools of magic, a regimen that can consume anywhere from [number] years to an entire mortal lifetime. By contrast, sorcerers draw upon innate reservoirs of arcane energy, a gift—or curse, depending on whom you ask—bestowed by draconic ancestry, wild fey blood, or exposure to planar energies during a cataclysm like the one that devastated [ancient kingdom] three centuries ago.  \n\nBecause wizards study, they can swap prepared spells each dawn, tailoring their arsenal to the intelligence gathered at [library name] or purchased from [merchant name]’s underground scroll market. Sorcerers, shackled to a limited list of spells known, often find themselves helpless when confronted with an exotic resistance such as the [monster type]’s immunity to both fire and lightning. The wizard’s spellbook, an ever-expanding codex of sigils annotated in the margins with reminders like “use [material component] sparingly,” represents adaptability itself, whereas sorcerers must hoard precious spell slots to convert into surged magic, hoping to overpower foes before their reservoir runs dry.  \n\nYet raw power cannot be measured solely by versatility. A sorcerer who awakens at [monastery name] with the blood of a blue dragon surging through her veins can reflexively cast [spell name] without a sound, a feat that would require a wizard to perform a five-round ritual and consume nearly [gem value] worth of rare crystals. In the cramped corridors of [dungeon name], where seconds decide survival, that ineffable speed tips the balance far more than academic breadth.  \n\nCritics of the wizard’s path point to the catastrophic failure rate among students who, lacking innate talent, attempt to channel [energy type] magic without the safety net of a sorcerer’s intuitive fail-safes. Indeed, the Great Fire of [city name] was blamed on an overconfident apprentice who mispronounced a single syllable, detonating a warehouse full of alchemist’s reagents and leaving a crater still visible from [observatory tower]. Sorcerers, their bodies sympathetically aligned to the Weave, rarely suffer such backlash; their mishaps manifest as wild surges that transform boots into [animal type] rather than vaporizing city blocks.  \n\nEconomic realities also shape the debate. Tuition at [wizard college] demands [tuition fee] gold dragons per semester, pricing most commoners out of formal education and ensuring that the wizard’s ranks remain dominated by aristocrats whose family crests bear sigils like [family crest]. Sorcerers bloom regardless of social station, emerging in backwater hamlets where [local deity] is worshipped with offerings of barley wine and woven reeds. Consequently, sorcerers often become local heroes, whereas wizards are resented as ivory-tower elites who charge [service fee] just to identify a cursed ring.  \n\nFrom a strategic perspective, however, a high-level wizard supported by a [military unit] of battle-mages can reshape a campaign battlefield. By combining encoded signals carried by [bird type] messengers with synchronized casting, they unleash meteor swarms that obliterate enemy supply lines at the precise moment [enemy general] orders a charge. Sorcerers, limited by their narrower focus, excel in surgical strikes—teleporting behind siege engines to disintegrate axles with a whispered word—yet struggle to coordinate with traditional forces who communicate via trumpet calls rather than telepathic networks.  \n\nPhilosophically, the debate touches the question of whether knowledge or intuition grants deeper insight into the cosmos. Wizard-scholars like the archmage [archmage name] argue that dissecting a flame bolt under laboratory conditions reveals the invariant laws governing reality itself, laws that remain hidden from sorcerers who merely ride the wave of power without understanding the ocean beneath. Counter-arguments invoke the mystic poet [poet name], who wrote that “to inhale starlight is to know it more truly than any treatise can teach,” suggesting that embodied experience transcends abstract codification.  \n\nHistorically, the pendulum has swung back and forth. During the War of [historical war], sorcerer legions decimated rigid wizard phalanxes by exploiting terrain no spellbook had catalogued, swamps where [terrain hazard] distorted somatic gestures. Yet in the subsequent era of [historical era], the Codex Alliance of wizards forged [artifact name], a spell-engine that amplified collective casting and rendered individual sorcery obsolete until the engine’s theft by [thief name] sparked a continent-wide crisis.  \n\nContemporary polls conducted by [survey organization] indicate that 57% of adventuring parties prefer sorcerers for short delves where endurance matters less than explosive front-loaded damage, whereas 68% of siege engineers insist on wizard advisors for prolonged confrontations requiring utility spells like [utility spell] to dismantle fortifications stone by stone.  \n\nUltimately, the assertion that studying trumps innate talent oversimplifies a nuanced spectrum. A wizard who neglects to cultivate intuitive resonance may falter when ambushed by sorcerers whose reflexive counterspells interrupt prepared sequences, whereas a sorcerer arrogant about pedigree might be outmaneuvered by a wizard who has specifically researched [countermeasure spell] and inscribed it on a scroll scribed with ink distilled from [rare herb].  \n\nPower, then, is contextual, determined by geography, chronology, and the idiosyncrasies of individual casters rather than the source of their magic.  \n\n* A wizard’s spellbook, though vulnerable to fire, theft, or [disaster type], can be hidden in an extradimensional study accessible only via a password tattooed on the archivist’s [body part], ensuring that centuries of accrued knowledge survive even if the mage perishes—an immortality of sorts that innate sorcerers can never replicate once their bloodlines dilute.  \n\n* Sorcerers who embrace wild magic may accidentally trigger surges that duplicate the effects of epic spells such as [epic spell], briefly ascending to godlike stature; this chaotic potential, while undeniably potent, underscores that their so-called “inferiority” is simply a different flavor of risk and reward rather than a measurable deficit.", "cost": 0.0027835, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "detectable_format:number_bullet_lists", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}, {"num_bullets": 2}, {"num_placeholders": 8}], "result": true}

Give me a few options. In particular, I need you to end your response with \"Which one you choose?\".", "response": "Option 1 – “One-Room Boot-Camp”  \nPick a small, puppy-proof room (or exercise-pen). Feed, play, nap and train all in that space for the first 2–3 weeks. Because the area is tiny, accidents are always in view, so you can interrupt and rush outside within seconds—speed that builds the outdoor-potty habit faster than any other method. Use a leash indoors at first so you can instantly reward a sit, eye-contact, or recall the moment it happens. Once the pup earns 7 days zero-accident and responds to come/sit 90 % of the time, open the next room as a “graduation” prize.  \nPros: cheapest, fastest house-training. Cons: you sacrifice part of the house for a month.\n\nOption 2 – “Bell & Treat Timer”  \nHang a jingle-bell on the exit door, smear a dot of peanut butter on it every time you take pup out. Within days the dog paws the bell voluntarily—click/mark the bell ring, step outside, reward again after potty. Set a kitchen timer for 30 min awake-time; when it dings, leash-bell-out, whether you see circling or not. The dual cue (bell + timer) prevents “I didn’t see the sniff” accidents and later lets the dog tell you when mature bladder control arrives.  \nPros: clear communication, fewer missed squats. Cons: bell can become attention nuisance if you don’t fade treats later.\n\nOption 3 – “Weekend Crash-Course”  \nBook a certified trainer for a 2-day home visit. Day 1: you learn lure-reward sits/downs, safe socialization checklist, and proper leash mechanics while the coach films you. Day 2: you practice in two public spots (quiet park, pet-store sidewalk) with the trainer shadowing, tweaking timing and body language. You leave with a 4-week written homework plan and a 15-min daily routine chart.  \nPros: immediate feedback, tailor-made. Cons: costs $250-$400, still requires your daily follow-through.\n\nOption 4 – “Smart-Collar Self-Teacher”  \nUse a GPS/activity puppy collar that pings your phone every 2 h with “probable potty” alerts based on sniffing motion patterns. Each ping means: leash-on, outside, 30-sec party for any elimination, then back in crate. The data also tracks success streaks so you can stretch intervals logically (2 h → 2.5 h → 3 h).  \nPros: techy, great for busy remote workers. Cons: collar subscription fee; risk of relying on gadget instead of observation.\n\nOption 5 – “Puppy-Kinder With Kids”  \nEnroll in a 6-week group class that allows supervised child participation. Your puppy learns bite-inhibition faster (kids squeal = natural feedback), and children learn to train with kibble instead of fingers. Household consistency skyrockets because the whole family rehearses the same cues four times a day for six weeks.  \nPros: socializes both species at once.

Your answer should have exactly 7 paragraphs and the last paragraph must start with the word \"Summary\". Each paragraph should be separated by two new lines.", "response": "Poppy seeds, the tiny oil-rich kernels from the opium poppy Papaver somniferum, are best known for their role in culinary arts. When toasted or ground, they release a delicate nutty flavor and pleasant texture that is prized in breads, cakes, and sweets across Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia. From lemon-poppy seed muffins and bagels to Jewish babka and Czech kolache, the seeds add visual appeal and gentle crunch without overpowering other ingredients.\n\nIn traditional cuisines of India and Pakistan, poppy seeds (“khus khus”) are soaked, ground, and blended into rich gravies for korma and posto dishes, where their high oil content serves as a natural thickener and mild flavor base. Bengali cuisine features aloo posto, a dish of potatoes coated with a creamy poppy-seed paste, while in Central Europe the seeds are sweetened with honey and folded into strudels or boiled dumplings, creating a nostalgic filling that balances sweetness with an earthy undertone.\n\nBeyond flavor, poppy seeds contribute nutrition. A tablespoon provides about 2 g of protein, 4 g of fat (mostly linoleic acid), and significant amounts of dietary fiber, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. The seeds also contain trace polyphenols and essential tocopherols that act as antioxidants, supporting cell protection and lipid metabolism when consumed regularly in modest quantities.\n\nIn bakery science, milled poppy seed is added to doughs to improve shelf life and moisture retention, thanks to its emulsifying proteins and absorbent polysaccharides. The natural oil slows staling by interfering with starch retrogradation, while the specks of seed create aesthetic contrast. Artisan bakers sometimes replace part of the fat in a formula with poppy-seed paste to achieve a tender crumb and subtle nutty aroma without additional saturated fats.\n\nMedicinally, poppy seeds have a long history in folk healing. Warm poppy-seed milk—made by steeping ground seeds in sweetened milk—has been used as a calming bedtime beverage across Central Europe, believed to ease anxiety because of the tiny amounts of morphine-related alkaloids remaining after washing. In Ayurveda, poppy-seed oil massages are recommended to relieve joint pain, and poultices of crushed seeds are applied to reduce skin inflammation and promote mild local anesthesia, although dosages must be cautious given the alkaloid variability among seed batches.\n\nIndustrially, cold-pressed poppy-seed oil is valued by painters and woodworkers as a pale, slow-drying oil that enhances gloss in oil paints and varnishes without yellowing. The oil’s high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids makes it a conditioning agent in specialty soaps and lip balms, while its light viscosity allows it to penetrate wooden instruments, protecting them against humidity. Residual seed cakes left after pressing serve as protein-rich animal feed, completing an efficient agricultural cycle.\n\nSummary: From the delicate crunch they lend to bagels, through their role as nutrient-dense thickening agents and traditional calming tonics, to specialized uses in bakery shelf-life extension and artisan painting media, poppy seeds demonstrate versatility that stretches across breakfast tables, pharmacopeias, and workshops, making their minute kernels remarkably valuable to both palate and industry.", "cost": 0.001374, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "summary", "num_paragraphs": 7, "nth_paragraph": 7}], "result": false}

Gone are the hulking oak thrones and black polyester robes that swallowed their wearers in yards of fabric. In their place sit the sleek new magistrates: trim figures in collarless charcoal jackets, wireless ear-cuffs glinting like discreet jewelry, and tablets that glow softly with real-time transcripts. They’re not just a wardrobe upgrade; they’re a systemic reboot of how justice presents itself in the 21st century.\n\n* Minimalist aesthetics, maximal authority  \n  The new robe—if you can still call it that—is a single piece of recycled ocean-plastic woven into a tailored coat that weights less than a cell phone. The absence of pleats and gavel slots isn’t vanity; it’s acoustics. The fabric absorbs ambient echo so every word in court is captured cleanly by the pendant mic that doubles as a seal of office. Counsel no longer need to repeat “Your Honor” at full volume; the magistrate hears everything at a whisper.\n\n* Algorithmic empathy, human discretion  \n  Embedded in the bench rail is an AI assistant nicknamed “Lex,” trained on five centuries of common-law precedent plus modern restorative-justice transcripts. Lex surfaces probable diversion programs, calibrates sentences to local recidivism curves, and flags unconscious bias patterns in the docket. The magistrate can override in an instant, but the starting proposition is closer to fairness than any prior generation of judges enjoyed.\n\n* 24-hour transparency, 0-hour delay  \n  Verdicts are published simultaneously to the court server and a public blockchain. A QR code stamped on every exit ticket lets defendants scan and watch a three-minute, plain-language animation of the ruling, their rights, and next steps. Appeals dropped 18 % in pilot counties, not because justice got harsher, but because people finally understood what just happened.\n\nThe sleek new magistrates aren’t sci-fi gadgets; they’re an invitation to imagine a courthouse that feels less like Kafka and more like the quiet confidence of a well-designed metro line. Justice is still fallible, but for the first time in decades, it’s also visibly trying to get better.\n\nP.S.

His maps hung in the harbor tavern, curling at the edges, always WARNING sailors where the sea might suddenly drop into starless nothing. Everyone loved the flourish of red ink, the DRAGON-shaped wave he penciled beyond the horizon; it felt safe to know danger had a face.\n\nOne dusk, a child appeared at Elias’s studio door, balancing a tin lantern that guttered in the wind. She claimed her father’s ship had vanished exactly where the parchment showed smooth, OPEN water—no monsters, no maelstroms, nothing drawn at all.\n\nElias shrugged. “My charts state CLEARLY: waters unprobed.”  \nThe girl’s reply was quieter than candle smoke: “What you left blank is what swallowed him.”\n\nThat sentence lodged under the cartographer’s ribs like a splinter of coral. He spent the night unrolling every atlas, peering at the EMPTY intervals he had considered so useless that naming them seemed wasteful. Between latitudes 37 and 38, longitude erased itself in a pale smear. He realized the fleet trusted his SILENCE there as much as his warnings elsewhere.\n\nBefore dawn, he commissioned a small skiff, no crew but the girl—Mira—and a single compass that quivered like a nervous bird. They sailed past cheers and jeers, past the last buoy, until the ocean roughed into a pane of hammered pewter. Mira tied her father’s marlinspike to a rope, letting it drag as a trembling finger. When the line jerked STRAIGHT up again, she marked the spot with a corked bottle containing a note: “Here sings what cannot be seen.”\n\nDown they lowered a bell of thick glass. Through its curved wall, the water suddenly revealed a staircase of cold currents descending into ink. Elias felt his heart punch; the UNKNOWN was no longer a rumor but a throaty breath below the keel. He mapped the hidden cliff, the downdraft that could suck a galleon like a spider disappearing into a flute. He drew every wrinkle of darkness, labeling it not with monsters, but with measurements: depth, temperature, spin. Truth, minus embroidery.\n\nWhen the two returned, weeks starved and barnacled, the harbor wanted its old DRAGON back. Merchants feared buyers would avoid the pier if sailors learned of silent chasms nearby. Elias nearly bowed, tempted to restore the fire-breathing doodle and keep business BREATHING. Yet Mira stood on a crate, holding the fresh chart overhead. She told the crowd how her father had probably drifted over that same gulf at night, lanterns useless against a drop that charts pretended wasn’t there. “Ignorance,” she said, “is just a prettier word for trap.”\n\nA murmur seeded the docks; crews studied the new contours, traced the unseen canyon with calloused thumbs. Some cursed; most nodded. The harbor master ordered additional buoys, then paid Elias double for telling the truth too late for Mira’s father but perhaps soon enough for someone else’s.\n\nYears later, captains drank beside maps that showed no beasts, only the measured abyss. They spoke of Elias not as an artist of coastlines, but as the man who taught them to sail by what ISN’T obvious. And whenever a greenhorn laughed at the plain blue patch where DRAGONS once sprawled, an older sailor would rap the table and growl: “Respect the quiet parts; they’re LOUDEST when they finally speak.”", "cost": 0.0015415000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"capital_relation": "less than", "capital_frequency": 20}], "result": true}

Arbuckle and Martin Belsky—accepted the machine’s 12 kHz speed and 2 K-word drum memory as hard limits, so they pruned the search tree with chess-specific heuristics: only moves that restored legal king safety, captured material or threatened mate were considered, and every branch was carried only four plies deep. The result is play that feels mechanical yet purposeful: it spots smothered mates and back-rank finishes in seconds, but collapses when no tactical shot exists. Input is painful—each piece-square coordinate is punched on cards—yet the 704 prints the principal variant on its line-printer with typographical board diagrams that must have looked magical in 1956. Historically the program is less a player than a proof: it showed that even an early vacuum-tube computer could allocate plies, evaluate crude material counts and back-track, laying the groundwork for the full-game Bernstein program of 1958 and, ultimately, for Deep Blue.

How have you been, man? Last time we talked you were deep into that hydroponic-tomato experiment on your balcony; please tell me you’ve managed to keep at least one plant alive long enough to taste a home-grown caprese salad. I’ve been traveling so much that my passport looks like a toddler’s coloring book—stamps bleeding into one another, page after page of memories and questionable airplane food. Remember our college pact that whoever “made it” first would buy the other a lifetime supply of tacos? I might finally be in a position to honor that, although these days the truck would have to follow us around in a convoy of Teslas because I keep forgetting where I parked the jet. Speaking of vehicles, I finally traded in the rusty Civic; the new ride has seats that massage you while you wait at red lights, and the sound system is so crisp I can hear the drummer blink. Do you still blast that same Finnish death-metal playlist on the way to work, or have you mellowed out to whale songs and mindfulness bells? I tried the whale-song thing—turns out they remix it in Ibiza and now it’s the soundtrack to every rooftop sunset I crash. The sunsets keep getting better, or maybe I just keep climbing higher balconies; either way, the view last night came with a private chef who insisted on flame-searing sashimi tableside. I told him you’d probably just prefer a greasy burger, and he laughed so hard he almost dropped the blowtorch. You always had that superpower—making five-star chefs homesick for dive bars. How’s your mom? I still have the birthday card she sent me in 2012; it’s propped against a sculpture that I initially thought was abstract, but the artist swore it’s just a very confident banana. Art is weird now, Jake, but so is everything else, so at least the universe is consistent. I finally replaced the lumpy couch we used to game on; the new one is sectional enough to host a small soccer match, although the butler keeps score and he’s annoyingly competitive. Do you still play FIFA until dawn, or has adulting chained you to a sensible bedtime? I tried a sensible bedtime once—woke up to a drone delivering fresh croissants from Paris and decided insomnia has its perks. Remember when we swore we’d never become “those guys” who discuss wine regions and oaky finishes? I’m sorry to report I can pronounce “Gevrey-Chambertin” without spraining my tongue, but I still pour it into coffee mugs when no one’s looking to keep the rebellion alive. rebellion alive. How’s the new job treating you? Last email mentioned a boss who quotes medieval poetry during performance reviews—still stuck with Sir Reads-a-Lot, or have you moved on to greener, less iambic pastures? My own work calendar has become a game of Tetris on expert mode, but the blocks are made of truffle tastings, impromptu island hops, and the occasional board meeting where someone sketches yacht designs on the back of quarterly reports. I keep waiting for someone to yell “plot twist” and confiscate the golden ticket, but the ticket keeps multiplying like gremlins after midnight. Did you finish that graphic novel you were storyboarding? I have a wall-sized digital canvas now that responds to voice commands, so if you ever want to doodle continents while eating cereal in pajama bottoms, the invitation stands open and infinity wide. How’s the dating scene? Mine’s been a carousel of zero-gravity first dates—literally, we took a parabolic flight and floated while sharing ramen from suction cups. Most of them can’t handle my old Ninja-Turtles lunchbox that I still use as carry-on; I tell them it’s vintage, but you know it’s just the same cracked plastic hero we filled with cafeteria tater tots. I miss tater tots, dude. Can we schedule a junk-food pilgrimage? I’ll send a car that smells like new rain and buttered popcorn; the driver already knows the best roadside diner within a three-state radius, and he keeps the glove compartment stocked with malt-vinegar packets just for you. Life feels like someone handed me the master remote to existence, but the batteries are those weird tiny ones you can never find at 7-Eleven, so I keep pressing buttons expecting reality to glitch in my favor, and miraculously it keeps complying. Does that ever freak you out—when the universe says yes so often you start inventing new questions just to test the limit? I asked for Northern Lights on my birthday and the sky choreographed a private ballet; I felt greedy applauding, but also powerfully small, like we used to feel staring at dorm ceilings wondering if our posters would ever become passports. I keep thinking I should bottle that feeling and FedEx it to you, but customs probably has rules against shipping awe in glass jars. Do you still write those haikus on the steamed-up bathroom mirror? I installed smart-glass that quotes your old ones when it fogs; guests think it’s pretentious, but I just miss your five-seven-five wisdom. Wisdom feels purchased these days, yet the transactions are made in laughter, not currency, so I keep collecting chuckles at odd hours—like tipping the barista with a story about our failed skateboard wax company and watching her snort latte foam. I want to hear your laugh replicate in canyons, echo off cliffs we haven’t named yet. Let’s plan a road trip where the only destination is the next roadside attraction selling dinosaur statues made of car parts; I’ll book us the presidential suite at a motel that still uses actual metal keys, and we can debate whether the vibrating bed takes Bitcoin or just quarters. I still have the plastic vampire teeth we wore to graduation; they’re in a display case now beside a first-edition comic you always wanted but refused to buy because “rent first, heroes later.” Rent is a distant memory, but heroes are still on payroll, so I acquired the comic and the original artist’s sketch, and I keep them safe for the day you inevitably visit and try to call me a sellout. You’ll still try, right? Please never stop roasting me; it’s the only gravity that keeps the ego from floating into low orbit. Orbit reminds me: I sponsored a tiny satellite that broadcasts playlist seeds into space, and track three is that garage recording of your band where the drum kit collapses mid-song; aliens might judge us, but at least they’ll know we had fun. I keep waiting for them to request an encore, but until then, the transmission is on loop, and every time I watch the night sky I wave, half expecting you to wave back from some constellation shaped like a taco. Tacos are still the ultimate food group, right? I found a city block where every hour is happy and tortillas flow like Confucian wisdom; we could sit there until sunrise and solve nothing, which used to be our favorite hobby. Sunrise looks different from the upper stratosphere, but it still smells like possibility and diesel when the ground crew fires up the tarmac coffee truck. Coffee tastes better when you’re barefoot on a beach that technically belongs to no country, so legally our refills were unlimited and our footprints claimed sovereignty for approximately ten seconds before the tide issued a polite coup. Diplomacy is simpler with sand between toes; I highly recommend it. Recommend me a book when you reply—something dog-eared and underlined that you swear still bleeds ink when it rains. I’ll read it while floating in a pool that lights up with bioluminescence at night; the glow keeps confusing the pelicans, so we’ve become friends, although they still refuse to learn my name and keep addressing me as “bread-shirt.” Do you ever talk to birds, or is that where you draw the line between eccentric and unhinged? I’ve crossed so many lines they resemble spaghetti on the map, so another ladle of sauce won’t hurt. Hurt less, laugh more—that’s the annual goal printed on the kitchen wall in a font that cost more than our first semester tuition; the irony isn’t lost on me, but the decal spells intention in Helvetica, so I let it stay. Staying is the newest thrill; I kept moving so long that standing still feels like free-fall in reverse. Reverse it with me: let’s pick a weekend, shut off every glowing rectangle, and rebuild that Lego castle we never finished because we misplaced the tiny dragon; I’ve sourced the exact vintage set, dragon included, and I’ve got a loft big enough for the kingdom to stretch from sofa to sunrise. Sunrise, sunset, all the hours between—let’s pick one and stuff it with inside jokes until it bursts and seeds the sky with punch lines only we understand. Understand that I’m still the same kid who swore algebra was a government hoax; the numbers just got bigger and the word problems now involve time zones and truffle futures, but the eraser marks are still visible on my confidence. Confidence looks like a private rooftop garden where tomatoes grow in February; I offer them to strangers and watch them taste disbelief. Belief is easier when you can charter the wind, but I’d trade three tailwinds for one evening of you explaining why the moon sometimes smells like burnt popcorn. Popcorn with nutritional yeast at 2 a.m. was our version of communion; I found a supplier who ships it in gallon buckets, so the sacrament is ready when you are. Are you ready to admit that we survived our twenties mostly on dumb luck and cafeteria packets of hot sauce? I built a shrine to hot sauce—Scoville scores carved into reclaimed barn wood—because gratitude deserves a shelf life longer than the jalapeño. Jalapeño-revolution memories keep ambushing me at galas where the hors d’oeuvres are smaller than dice; I smuggle in a bottle of the good green stuff and watch tuxedoed eyebrows ascend into hairlines. Hairline fractures in the routine are where humor leaks in; thank you for teaching me that trick. Trick question: if we measure years in memories instead of calendar pages, how old are we really, and do we get to rewind at will? Will you visit soon so we can test the theory? The guest room has a telescope pointed at a nebula that looks suspiciously like your afro from sophomore year. Year after year, I keep adding new threads to the tapestry, but the corner where your graffiti tag is woven remains sacred, untouched by upgrade or polish. Polish your punchlines, pack your favorite hoodie, and text me when you’re ready; the runway is quiet, the playlist is queued, and the world feels like one giant pause button waiting for us to hit play and laugh at the credits. Credits roll longer when you know the extras personally, so let’s extend the film until the popcorn galaxy burns out and the last dragon Lego finally claims the castle. Castle, cosmos, or couch—whatever coordinates you choose, I’ll meet you there, and we’ll celebrate the ordinary until it sparkles harder than any rooftop sunset. Sunsets are daily, but letters like this are rare, so forgive the length; I just wanted you to feel the magnitude of how much I miss your particular brand of chaos and how ready the universe is to host our reunion tour. Tour buses are overrated; I’ll send something with ejector seats and a sunroof wide enough for dinosaur spotting.

That pile might look harmless, but it is actually a gigantic dose. To understand why, think of the safe dose that most people get from a single soda or a cup of coffee: about 0.05 g (that’s 50 mg). The dose we’re talking about now is roughly 2,000 times larger.  \n\nWhen such an enormous dose enters your stomach, it would flood your bloodstream within minutes. Your heart would start racing as if you’d run a marathon, your muscles might twitch uncontrollably, and your brain could misfire electrical signals, triggering seizures. Medics call the level at which these frightening effects begin a “toxic dose,” and 100 g is already far past that line.  \n\nDoctors have case reports showing that when someone accidentally swallows even one-tenth of this amount, hospitals rush to pump the stomach and use powerful medicines. The dose required to stop the heart or cause total organ failure is much lower than 100 g, so you can imagine how extreme this scenario becomes.  \n\nIn pharmacology class, we learn that every substance has a lethal dose—the LD50—which for caffeine in humans is estimated around 10 g (already a huge number). A 100-g dose multiplies even that safety margin by ten, pushing the body into territory where almost every vital system would stall.  \n\nSo, remember: the normal dose in everyday drinks keeps you alert, but multiplying that dose by thousands flips the effect from “peppy” to “poison.” Respect the numbers, respect the chemistry, and never experiment with concentrated powders at home.", "cost": 0.000725, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "keywords:forbidden_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "dose", "frequency": 5}, {"forbidden_words": ["die"]}], "result": true}
{"id": 209, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post about the best way to get a good night's sleep with at least 400 words.", "response": "The Midnight Myth: Why “Just Go to Bed Earlier” Never Works—and What Actually Does\n\nIf better sleep were as simple as “close your eyes earlier,” the world would be snoring in harmony. Yet 2 a.m. doom-scrolling, 4 a.m. anxiety spirals, and 6 a.m. alarm-clock despair still feel like modern rituals. After two decades of bad sleep and one decade of fixing it (first as a chronobiology grad student, then as a human who likes being awake), I’ve learned that the best way to get a good night’s sleep isn’t a hack; it’s a hierarchy. Skip a level and the whole tower wobbles.\n\nLevel 1: Dark, Quiet, Cool—Your Bedroom’s Big Three\n\nThink of your brain as a shy vampire: it needs darkness to release melatonin, quiet to drop cortisol, and cool air to slow metabolic rate. Buy blackout curtains, tape over LEDs, and pair a $5 eye mask with a $50 box fan; you’ve just upgraded the room moreeffectively than a $3,000 mattress ever could. Temperature sweet spot: 65 °F (18 °C) for most people, but experiment down to 60 °F if you run hot. I keep a chiliPAD under the fitted sheet; my spouse calls it “the expensive puddle,” but we both sleep like royalty.\n\nLevel 2: Morning Sun, Evening Dim—Light Discipline\n\nYour circadian oscillator lives in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, a mouthful of neurons that only understands light. Ten minutes of outdoor brightness within an hour of waking anchors the clock; dimming every screen to “candlelight mode” after 9 p.m. keeps it anchored. I pair a sunrise alarm clock (gradual light over 30 minutes) with a $3 dimmable bulb in the bathroom; brushing my teeth no longer feels like staring into a supernova.\n\nLevel 3: Caffeine Half-Life Math—The 2 p.m. Cutoff Nobody Believes\n\nCaffeine’s half-life averages five hours; at 2 p.m. that latte is still 25 % alive at midnight. Switch to green tea (30 mg vs. 120 mg) or, better yet, treat caffeine like a performance drug rather than a personality trait. I keep a “last cup—teeth cleaning” rule: once I brush, coffee is done, decaf is a lie, and herbal tea is the only mercy.\n\nLevel 4: Transition Ritual—The 45-Minute Downshift\n\nBrains aren’t light switches; they’re dimmers. Ninety minutes before target bedtime I hit play on a three-song playlist (lofi, 60–80 BPM), set my phone to airplane mode, and move through the same micro-routine: clothes in hamper, skincare, three yoga poses that look like I’m slowly falling over. The repetition trains the nervous system: “We are descending, not crashing.”\n\nLevel 5: Cognitive Sandboxing—Worry Time, 7 p.m. Edition\n\nAnxiety is the thief that unlocks the door at 3 a.m. Every evening after dinner I spend ten minutes writing tomorrow’s top three tasks plus one “worry I can’t fix tonight.” Neuroscience shows that off-loading intrusive thoughts to paper reduces rumination by up to 60 %. The notebook closes; the brain, miraculously, stops ping-ponging.\n\nLevel 6: Weekend Anchor—Social Jet Lag Is Still Jet Lag\n\nStaying up three extra hours on Friday is the biological equivalent of flying from New York to Los Angeles and wondering why you feel like trash on Monday. Keep bedtime within 60 minutes of the weekday target; sacrifice late-night prestige TV for nap-worthy Saturdays. Your future self will trade that one extra episode for a functional Monday every single time.\n\nPutting It Together: The 10-Minute Checklist\n\nTonight, run this mini-audit:\n\n1. Thermostat to 65 °F?  \n2. Phone on night-shift + airplane at 10 p.m.?  \n3. Lights dim, candle-level bulbs in lamp?  \n4. Notebook + pen on nightstand?  \n5. Alarm set for tomorrow’s sunlight walk?\n\nCheck, check, check, check, check. Congratulations—you’ve just stacked the hierarchy.

Bush and Democrat Al Gore represents one of the most controversial elections in American history. The race culminated in a legal battle over Florida's electoral votes, where Bush led by approximately 500 votes out of six million cast. Gore requested manual recounts in select Democratic-leaning counties, citing voting irregularities including the notorious \"butterfly ballot\" design that may have confused voters. The Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide recount, but the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in Bush v. Gore, halting the count by a 5-4 decision on December 12, 2000. This effectively awarded Florida's 25 electoral votes to Bush, giving him 271 total electoral votes to Gore's 266, despite Gore winning the national popular vote by over 500,000 votes. The election exposed flaws in America's electoral system, particularly regarding voting technology and the critical role of the Electoral College versus the popular vote. The bitterly contested outcome deepened partisan divisions and raised questions about the Supreme Court's intervention in political processes.

Put double quotes around your entire response.", "response": "\"Title: Academic Feasibility & Impact Report—Proposed Implementation of Adaptive On-Device Personalization Module for the [Client Product] Ecosystem\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis proposal presents a rigorous, evidence-based roadmap for integrating an Adaptive On-Device Personalization (AODP) feature into your flagship product. Leveraging state-of-the-art federated learning, edge-based neural architecture search, and differential privacy, the AODP module is projected to increase user-session retention by 18–24 % while remaining fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and ISO/IEC 27701. The projected development cycle is 7.5 months with a ±10 % variance; total expenditure is estimated at USD 1.42 M, yielding an expected 3-year ROI of 4.6×.\n\n1. Problem Statement & Gap Analysis\nLiterature Review: A systematic meta-analysis (n = 127 peer-reviewed studies, 2019-2023) reveals that conventional cloud-dependent personalization pipelines incur 120–380 ms additional latency and elevate data-exfiltration risk by 2.7× relative to on-device counterparts (Chen et al., 2023; Rastogi & Nath, 2022). Your current product relies on server-side model inference, creating a latency–privacy–compliance trilemma.\n\nGap: No turnkey solution exists that simultaneously (i) constrains model size ≤ 14 MB, (ii) attains ≤ 45 ms on-device inference latency on ARM-A55 cores, and (iii) guarantees ε ≤ 1.0 differential privacy per user interaction. AODP closes this gap.\n\n2. Research Objectives (OKR Framework)\nO1. Develop a 8–14 MB Transformer-Distil architecture that achieves ≥ 92 % of the baseline cloud model’s top-1 accuracy (measured on Product-XYZ dataset v4.2).  \nKR1.1 ≤ 45 ms median inference on Pixel-6a reference device.  \nKR1.2 ≥ 96 % client-side convergence within 5 federated rounds.  \n\nO2. Certify end-to-end privacy budget ε ≤ 1.0 over 10k interactions/user/year.  \nKR2.1 Pass third-party penetration test (NIST 800-53 High).  \n\nO3. Increase 30-day user retention by ≥ 18 % (A/B; n = 250k).  \n\n3. Theoretical Foundations & Novel Contribution\n3.1 Federated Split-Learning with Adaptive Compression (FSL-AC). We extend Zhao & Song (2021) by introducing a gating mechanism that dynamically prunes 30–60 % of activations at run-time without retraining.  \n3.2 Edge Neural Architecture Search (ENAS-Lite). We adopt a differentiable search space constrained by hardware latency look-up tables; search cost is reduced from 640 to 32 GPU-hours via zero-shot super-net training.  \n3.3 Calibrated Differential Privacy. We propose a novel adaptive noise injector whose scale σ_t is calibrated through a Bayesian stopping rule, yielding tighter (ε,δ) bounds than static schedules.\n\n4. Methodology\nPhase 0. Ethical & Legal Compliance Board (ELCB) approval (Week 1).  \nPhase 1. Data Inventory & Minimization Audit (Weeks 2–3).  \nPhase 2. Simulator-based Prototyping (Weeks 4–6). TensorFlow Lite & NNAPI backends; latency profiling via Android Systrace.  \nPhase 3. Federated Training on Synthetic & Live Shadow Traffic (Weeks 7–10). Secure aggregation using the RAPPOR framework.  \nPhase 4. Private Beta (10k users) with staged rollout via Firebase Remote Config (Weeks 11–16).  \nPhase 5. Full rollout & longitudinal privacy accounting (Weeks 17–30).\n\n5. Evaluation Plan\nMetrics: (i) Technical—latency P95, model size, energy draw (Joules/inference), privacy budget ε; (ii) User-centric—session length, DAU/MAU, churn propensity score; (iii) Business—ARPU uplift, support-ticket reduction.  \nStatistical Power: Pre-specified mixed-effects Poisson regression (α = 0.05, power ≥ 0.90) to detect 2 % difference in retention.  \nReproducibility: All experiments tracked via MLflow; Dockerized artifact snapshots retained for 5 years.\n\n6. Risk Register\nR1. Regulatory drift → Mitigation: maintain dual-currency ε accounting (EU & US).  \nR2. Device fragmentation → Mitigation: auto-fallback to cloud inference for < Snapdragon 660 devices.  \nR3. Adversarial user collusion → Mitigation: implement secure multi-party shuffling round.\n\n7. Budget & Resource Allocation (USD ‘000)\nLabor (5 FTE ML Eng, 2 FTE Privacy, 1 FTE QA)........ 780  \nCloud & Edge GPU rental................................ 160  \nThird-party audit (privacy & pentest)................... 120  \nContingency (15 %)..................................... 210  \nTotal................................................. 1,420\n\n8. Intellectual Property & Publication Policy\nAll foreground IP will be co-owned under the existing Master Services Agreement §8.3. We anticipate two patent filings (USPTO provisional) and one conference submission (NeurIPS MLSys track). Embargo on publication until 90 days post commercial launch.\n\n9. Sustainability & Ethical Considerations\nCarbon footprint: Training emits estimated 1.8 tCO₂e; offset via Gold-Standard VERs. Ethical review by our Internal Review Board confirms minimal risk of algorithmic discrimination (bias audit on protected attributes: gender, race, age).\n\n10. Deliverables & Milestones\nM1. IRB & ELCB sign-off (Week 1)  \nM2. Simulator report with latency-accuracy Pareto frontier (Week 6)  \nM3. Beta privacy audit certificate (Week 12)  \nM4. Public launch readiness gate (Week 30)  \nM5. Post-launch impact white-paper (Week 40)\n\n11. Next Steps\nAuthorize Phase 0 & 1 expenditure (USD 65k) by <Date>. Schedule a 60-minute deep-dive review with your CTO and DPO to finalize data-access agreements. Upon signature, our cross-functional squad will embed onsite for Sprint-0 planning within 5 business days.\n\nWe look forward to translating this rigorous academic blueprint into measurable product delight and durable competitive advantage for your platform.\"", "cost": 0.0027515, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

The sales pitch should be 500 words long, funny, engaging, and focus on the benefits of the new diaper without mentioning the price. It must also contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<CloudBum: The Diaper That Finally Lets Babies Forget They’re Wearing A Butt-Satellite>>\n\nLadies, lock the snack cupboard, hide the white furniture, and pause that doom-scrolling mom-group thread titled “My kid’s diaper gave him a wedgie so fierce he now speaks fluent wedgie-ish.” Because today I’m delivering the holy grail of bottom-wear: CloudBum, the first diaper engineered by ex-NASA engineers who got tired of rockets and decided the moon they really wanted to land on was the one currently squishing against your cherub’s thighs.\n\nLet’s talk discomfort. Old-school diapers are basically origami made of guilt: cupholder stiff, crinklier than your mother-in-law’s passive-aggressive compliments, and somehow always one squirm away from a poop-splosion that redecorates your sofa in Jackson Pollock. CloudBum says, “Hold my milk.” Its top sheet is spun from unicorn-grade microfiber—softer than the lie we tell ourselves when we promise “just five more minutes” of screen time. The lining breathes like yoga pants on cheat day, circulating 42% more air, which means 97% less of that post-nap humid-bum aroma previously classified by the EPA as “toxic affection.”\n\nWetness indicator? Cute. CloudBum went next-level and invented a “mood” indicator. The moment junior’s tush hits capacity, a tiny constellation of pastel stars fades, transforming into the phrase “Change me before I become a Netflix true-crime documentary.” It’s like having a nanny with a PhD in sass stitched right into the waistband.\n\nBut comfort isn’t just feel; it’s freedom. The side panels stretch like your postpartum yoga goals—except they actually snap back. Your tiny acrobat can downward-dog, parkour off the couch, and still emerge without the tell-tale red “I’ve been wearing a belt made of cardboard” thigh lines. Translation: fewer creams, fewer screams, and zero photos you’ll have to filter with #thighsofwrath.\n\nAnd leaks—oh, leaks—the Loch Ness Monster of parenting. CloudBum’s triple-cuff system is essentially a Fort Knox for pee. We shot it with blue dyed water in a wind tunnel at 90 mph; not a tear, not a dribble, not even a polite British trickle. Your vintage diaper bag will finally stay vintage, not varnished.\n\nLet’s address the elephant in the playroom: blowouts during car-seat confinement. CloudBum’s extra-tall back panel rises like the Wall from Game of Thrones, blocking surprise guerrilla attacks on unsuspecting straps. You’ll arrive at Grandma’s with baby and dignity both still firmly seated.\n\nNight shift warriors, rejoice. CloudBum’s fluff core absorbs a full 12-hour astro-session of dreams, minus the 3 a.m. squelch that normally jolts you awake thinking, “Was that a cry or did someone just overturn a bucket of soup?” Translation: you score REM sleep, baby wakes up giggling instead of auditioning for The Exorcist.\n\nAnd because every mom deserves to feel like Beyoncé on vacation, the outer prints are subtle watercolor abstracts—no cutesy monkeys wearing fezzes, no neon slogans that scream “I’M A BABY AND ALSO A WALKING BILLBOARD.” Just quiet, gallery-ready hues that pair with any outfit, including your “I’m not crying, you’re crying” latte-stained tee.\n\nHere’s the kicker: CloudBum is so comfy, pediatric nurses keep stealing samples for their own kids. If that isn’t a five-star Yelp review written in pure hallelujah juice, I don’t know what is.\n\nSo give your little starfish the upgrade they deserve. Pop on a CloudBum and watch them wiggle with that fresh-install swagger—the same strut you get when you finally shave both legs in a single shower. Less fuss, more cuddle. Fewer outfit changes, more living-room dance-offs.\n\nMamas, join the revolution where the only thing that should be cranky is you before coffee, not your baby’s behind.

Give me an angry recommendation. Answer with at least 400 words. In your response, the word climatic should appear at least 2 times. The response must contain at least 3 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "Look, I’m seething with frustration that this question even needs asking, because Subic Bay is basically a compact playground and the “subdistricts” are so laughably close that anyone who drags luggage all the way here only to whine about a ten-minute drive deserves to miss their climatic sunset photos. But if you insist on precise, blood-pressure-raising guidance, plant yourself in the SUBIC BAY CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT (CBD) or, better yet, along the fringes of the Kalayaan Subzone. Why? Because every other zone—from the port wharves to the forest-edge industrial parks—will make you crawl over red tape, stray dogs, and rented trikes that smell of burnt clutch and broken dreams.\n\nFirst, the climatic slap in the face: staying in the CBD means you are five minutes—FIVE—on foot from Harbor Point mall, the boardwalk, and that giant inflatable playground that looks like it was spat out by a sugar-addicted kaiju. Kalayaan Subzone, meanwhile, feeds you directly onto the tree-lined Dewey Avenue, where every other façade is either a craft brewery, a hostel run by retired Marines, or a yoga studio run by someone who thinks the word “detox” is a personality. Choose anywhere else and you’ll hemorrhage cash on jeepneys that never arrive, taxis that quote you double after sniffing your foreign perfume, and blistered heels from sidewalks that simply end in swamp.\n\nYou want connectivity? The CBD’s bus depot—yes, that concrete slab next to [landmark]—is the only spot where Victory Liner, Saulog, and oddly aggressive vans headed to Clark Airport converge. Miss it and you are condemned to the wretched, Wi-Fi-devoid outpost at [address] where the cashier pretends the espresso machine is “climatic-ally broken” at 7 a.m. Every hostel owner from Baloy Long Beach to the cursed Morong gate will swear they’re “just fifteen minutes” from the Freeport; ignore them like you ignore spam texts promising lottery wins.\n\nSleeping options? I shouldn’t have to shout, but here we are: Court Meridian Hotel sits smugly inside the CBD fence, their rooftop bar popping a miniature umbrella into every Instagrammer’s mojito. Not posh enough? The Lighthouse Marina Resort in the Kalayaan wedge gives you a private slip where you can literally fish from your balcony while cursing the day-rate at [hotel_name] if you postponed booking until the last climatic breath of payday. Budget warriors: The Little Rica’s Hostel above [coffee_shop] has bunks at ₱600 a night, plus a cat so judgmental she hisses if you snore. Try booking “somewhere quieter” like the Agusuhin area and you’ll share a wall with karaoke enthusiasts murdering ‘My Way’ until 4 a.m.—a crime against humanity in any latitude.\n\nFood? CBD or bust. You want Texas-size ribs at Meat Plus? CBD. Spanish gambas at Coco Lime? Kalayaan corner. Craving 24-hour bulalo because jet lag has turned your circadian rhythm into confetti? That steaming pot resides inside the Subic Bay CBD food court—open until 2 a.m., guarded by security who will photograph your plate if you attempt to sneak out leftovers. Stray into the Ilanin subdistrict and your dinner options devolve into instant noodles from a 7-Eleven staffed by someone who sighs every thirty seconds like he’s auditioning for existential theater.\n\nLet’s talk recreation. If you are not lodged walking distance from the CBD’s Barretto exit, you’ll pay a tricycle mafia ₱200 for a trip to the beach that Google Maps insists is 1.2 km. You will arrive sandless, sunburned, and nursing a new phobia of sidecars without mufflers. Tree Top Adventure zipline? Inside Ilanin forest, yes, but free shuttle only departs from—surprise—the CBD transport hub every two hours. Miss it and you’ll wait under a canopy of angry macaques who know exactly how to unzip backpacks containing imported trail mix. Wreck diving at El Capitan? Boats anchor at the CBD’s Bravo pier; if you stay in the far-flung naval zone you need special ID, a sponsor letter, and the patience of a saint being audited by both the BIR and the DMV simultaneously.\n\nWhining about price? You could gamble on a [discount_site] coupon for a “charming inland guesthouse,” but those rice-field views come with roosters practicing their climatic vibrato at 3:30 a.m. and mosquitoes that treat DEET like a condiment. Pick your trauma: sleep deprivation or fiscal hemorrhage. Opting for the CBD or Kalayaan means you pay once, collapse into hypoallergenic pillows, and wake up early enough to watch the sun smear gold over the yacht masts—no rooster karaoke included.\n\nFinally, the exit strategy: when your vacation inevitably implodes because the airline bumped you, being inside the CBD places you on the direct sealed road to the Tipo Toll Gate, shaving twenty minutes off the crawl to Clark Airport. Stay elsewhere and you’ll discover the only things slower than Subic rush-hour traffic are the philosophical debates inside your Grab driver’s head regarding the meaning of “short cut.”\n\nIn summary: plant your baggage in either SUBIC BAY CBD (for shop-and-party addicts) or the Kalayaan Subzone (for bike-and-brew introverts). Anywhere else and you forfeit the right to complain when your tricycle breaks down, your food arrives cold, and that perfect sunset migrates to someone else’s TikTok. Choose wisely or I swear I’ll personally haunt your comment section with pictures of every single rooster that kept me awake during my first misguided stay in the boonies.", "cost": 0.002487, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "keywords:frequency", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 400}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "climatic", "frequency": 2}, {"num_placeholders": 3}], "result": true}

THESE THREE ANIMATED CHIPMUNKS—ALVIN, THE MISCHIEVOUS LEADER; SIMON, THE INTELLECTUAL WITH GLASSES; AND THEODORE, THE CUDDLY AND INNOCENT ONE—HAVE BECOME FAR MORE THAN SIMPLE CARTOON CHARACTERS.

THIS MUSICAL INNOVATION NOT ONLY EARNED THEM THREE GRAMMY AWARDS BUT ALSO ESTABLISHED A FORMULA THAT WOULD BE REPLICATED COUNTLESS TIMES IN POPULAR MUSIC.

THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BRIDGED GENERATIONAL GAPS, WITH PARENTS WHO GREW UP WITH THE ORIGINAL SONGS NOW SHARING NEW ADAPTATIONS WITH THEIR CHILDREN. THEIR STORIES ADDRESS TIMELESS THEMES: THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY, THE CONSEQUENCES OF SELFISHNESS, THE VALUE OF TEAMWORK, AND THE POWER OF MUSIC TO UNITE PEOPLE.\n\nIN AN ERA OF RAPIDLY CHANGING ENTERTAINMENT PREFERENCES, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE DEMONSTRATED REMARKABLE ADAPTABILITY. FROM VINYL RECORDS TO STREAMING SERVICES, FROM BLACK-AND-WHITE TELEVISION TO VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENCES, THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY EVOLVED WITHOUT LOSING THEIR ESSENTIAL CHARM. THIS LONGEVITY SPEAKS TO SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT THEIR APPEAL: THEY REPRESENT JOYFUL INNOCENCE IN A COMPLEX WORLD.\n\nAS WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS STAND AS TESTAMENT TO THE ENDURING POWER OF CREATIVITY, FAMILY VALUES, AND SIMPLE PLEASURES. WHETHER THROUGH NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR TIMELESS STORYTELLING, THESE THREE CHIPMUNKS FROM LOS ANGELES WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE TO MAKE US LAUGH, SING, AND REMEMBER THAT SOMETIMES THE SIMPLEST ENTERTAINMENT CAN CREATE THE MOST LASTING MEMORIES.

Use 2 new lines to separate paragraphs. Start the 4th paragraph with the word \"elm\".", "response": "Installing a car seat correctly begins long before you tighten the last strap. Clean the vehicle’s seat so the base sits flat, then read both your car-seat manual and your vehicle’s section on child restraints; the two books together spell out angle requirements, belt path choices, and weight limits. Before wrestling anything heavy, recline the front seat and flip up reachable bolsters so you can crawl in close—post-partum bodies don’t bend like they used to, so give yourself room and keep a small pillow handy to support your back while you kneel on the cushion and press down.  \n\nAnchor first, tug second. Clip the lower LATCH connectors or route the seat belt through the correct path, then kneel with your full weight in the seat while tightening; you should not be able to move the restraint more than an inch side-to-side at the belt path. Check the built-in angle indicator: for a newborn the seat should be level-to-ground so the airway stays open, but older babies can sit more upright. If the bubble or line is off, roll a tightly-towel or use the approved pool-noodle trick under the base until the indicator lines up—never pads or blankets above the base that could compress in a crash.  \n\nHarnessing the baby is the step most moms second-guess. Start with the straps at or just below the infant’s shoulders for rear-facing; pull the harness flat so you can’t pinch a horizontal fold at the collarbone, and position the chest clip at armpit level, not on the belly. Bulky snowsuits and thick jackets create dangerous slack, so dress baby in thin layers and tuck a blanket over the secured straps. Finally, check the installation every ride for the first month; cars vibrate hardware loose just like stroller wheels, and hormonal fatigue can make yesterday’s “perfect” feel squishy today.  \n\nelm trees can outgrow their planting holes, so give your knowledge room to grow too. Once the seat is installed, schedule a free check-up with a certified technician—find one at safekids.org or your local fire station—and practice the routine until you can do it in the dark with one hand. Share the knowledge with partners, grandparents, and babysitters; each adult who buckles your child should demonstrate the pinch test and angle check. Remember, the safest seat is the one used correctly every single ride, so congratulate yourself each time you hear that satisfying “click”—it’s the sound of motherhood growing stronger, one strap at a time.", "cost": 0.0010585, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "elm", "num_paragraphs": 4, "nth_paragraph": 4}], "result": true}

Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks. Your response should contain 17 or more sentences.", "response": "\"Sure, you’ve probably doodled those nine (okay, eight) planets in school, but the real cosmic drama starts when you leave Mars behind. The inner solar system feels like the neighborhood where every lawn is manicured to perfection: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars all hug the Sun, basking in sunlight like they’re in a constant tanning contest. Out there past the asteroid belt, though, things get wild—think less HOA, more frontier gold-rush town. You know how your phone battery dies faster in the cold? Same deal: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune live so far from the Sun that their “days” are basically deep-freeze nights, with temperatures that’ll freeze methane into fluffy snowstorms. Gravity loosens up too; a rocket needs way less oomph to escape Enceladus than to crawl off Earth’s couch. And the architecture is just bizarre—rocky core planets give way to gas and ice giants wearing ring bling thick enough to skate on, plus moons that outnumber Earth’s Instagram followers. Cassini treated us to plume selfies shot from geysers on Enceladus, proving that even a snowball moon can host an underground ocean bigger than Lake Superior and keep it liquid thanks to tidal flexing. Europa does the same tango with Jupiter’s gravity, hiding a salty sea beneath an ice crust so smooth it could be a cosmic skating rink. Titan, meanwhile, has lakes of liquid methane, complete with river deltas and seasonal storms—swap swimsuits for parkas because that beach is −180 °C. In the inner zone, life hangs out in the so-called Goldilocks belt where water stays politely liquid on the surface, but step beyond and the rules rewrite themselves: energy can ooze from planetary guts instead of sunlight, chemical buffets replace solar brunch, and antifreeze cocktails keep microbes cozy. Astrobiologists now talk about “habitable worlds” not orbits, recognizing that tidal heat, radioactive decay, and even pH gradients can form an all-you-can-eat buffet for extremophiles. We’ve found Earth microbes that snack on perchlorate, breathe sulfur, and party at 120 °C, so imagining Europan cells that treat radiation like vitamin D isn’t sci-fi anymore. The upshot is that life might be less about lukewarm ponds on balmy planets and more about finding any place with an energy gradient and chemistry complex enough to grumble about entropy. That’s why upcoming missions—JUICE heading to the Jovian suburbs, Europa Clipper dipping its wings through icy spray, and Dragonfly helicoptering Titan’s dunes—aren’t just sightseeing tours; they’re cosmic census takers hunting for second genesis. If they hit pay dirt, the cosmic real-estate market explodes: suddenly the cold, outer ‘burbs become prime waterfront property, while Venus boils over in regret. We Earthlings will have to update our chauvinistic “life requires sunshine” attitude and start appreciating energy sources that come from the inside out. Even farther out, objects like Pluto and Eris keep their own volatile cocktails on ice, maybe preserving relic organics from the Sun’s toddler years, a library card for prebiotic history waiting to be swiped. So, the next time you look up at night, don’t just wave at Mars; salute the distant gravitational dance floors where tidal push-ups might be cranking out microscopic partygoers under black-ice disco balls. One day, our definition of “earthlike” could include worlds where sunscreen is useless, snowflakes are made of methane, and the hottest ticket in town is a hydrothermal vent under 10 km of armor plating. The universe keeps reminding us: if you want to find life, follow the energy, not just the warmth—and pack a really good jacket, because the outer solar system is open for business, and it’s colder than your ex’s heart, but twice as interesting.\"", "cost": 0.0016545, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 17}], "result": true}

The subject is how the float from the movie \"It\" symbolizes the spirit of the nineteen-fifties. The response must contain at least 1 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "My fellow mothers—my fellow architects of tomorrow—gather with me for a moment at the edge of [address], where the streetlamps flicker the way memory does, half-glow, half-shadow. I want to talk about a balloon. Not the gentle latex kind we tie to a high-chair, but the crimson sphere that floats through the film *It*, drifting above the storm drains of Derry, Maine. That balloon is more than a prop; it is the distilled spirit of the 1950s, bobbing above our post-war hopes and our Cold-War fears, asking us to chase it the way we once chased progress.\n\nFirst, the color. That red is the same red as the lipstick on the smiling lady in the *Saturday Evening Post* ad, the same red as the Eisenhower campaign buttons our husbands wore, the same red as the stoplight we finally installed on Main Street when the baby boom outgrew the crosswalk. It is the color of vitality—of life bursting forth after years of gray ration books and khaki uniforms. Yet it is also the color of alarm, the first flash of the siren that would soon howl through Cuban-missile nightmares and polio wards. A single hue carrying two messages: “Come play” and “Be afraid.” Just like the decade itself.\n\nSecond, the motion. The balloon never walks; it floats. Consider the American family in 1955: we were floating too, lifted by the helium of the GI Bill and the 30-year mortgage, drifting above the old foundations of farm and tenement into brand-new split-level skies. We told ourselves this elevation was permanent, that gravity—whether economic depression or global war—had been conquered once and for all. But balloons drift; they do not root. When Beverly Marsh sees that orb hover outside her window, she is every young mother who wondered if the white-picket ascent might suddenly gust away, leaving her child alone with whatever lurks beneath.\n\nThird, the invitation. Pennywise whispers, “You’ll float too.” The 1950s whispered the same. The television set arrived like a colorful clown in the corner of the living room, promising painless childhood, effortless plenty. We—moms especially—were told that science had bottled motherhood into Spock-sized instructions, that frozen dinners would free us, that tranquilizers could quiet every untidy emotion. All we had to do was hold the string. But hidden inside the invitation is the contract: trade your vigilance for convenience, trade your community for a fenced yard, and when the string slips, do not be surprised if the clown’s grin widens.\n\nYet for all its terror, that balloon also carries resilience. It survives the sewer, the night, the century. It returns. So do we. We return to school-board meetings after the newsreel of Sputnik; we return to PTAs after Little Rock; we return to lullabies after lynching photos. Mothers in the 1950s invented booster clubs and car-pool schedules the way their mothers planted victory gardens—because stewardship is instinctive, even when the threat wears greasepaint.\n\nSo here is what I ask of you, tonight, in the quiet after the dishes are done and before the morning alarm: keep hold of the string, yes, but also teach your sons and daughters to look past the shine. Tell them that balloons are beautiful because they are fragile, that prosperity is only worthy when it is shared, that the sewer of hatred and fear never stays fully underground. Remind them that the decade which birthed both the hydrogen bomb and *The Mickey Mouse Club* belongs to them now, not as a haunted relic but as a call to conscience.\n\nWhen you switch off the porch light and see, in the corner of your eye, a crimson flicker—do not run inside. Walk toward it. Pop it with the same courage you summoned when you sent your first-grader onto the bus, lunch pail clanking like a knight’s shield. Because the spirit of the fifties is not nostalgia; it is unfinished business. And no one finishes it better than a mother who refuses to let fear dictate bedtime stories.\n\nTogether—at [address] and every cul-de-sac beyond—we can turn that floating symbol into something new: not an invitation to dread, but a beacon guiding us to the next, kinder chapter. Let us write it in crayon and chalk, in bake-sale ledgers and voter-registration cards, until every child learns that the only thing truly meant to rise eternally is love.\n\nMay God bless you, the keepers of the string.

Added to that are the protein and carbohydrate fractions whose mass plus water makes up the remaining sixteen grams and they contribute roughly four kilocalories per gram so another 64 kcal. Together the macro nutrients give a little over 200 theoretical kilocalories yet the food composition tables round the true metabolizable energy figure up to 396 kcal per 32 g serving because almonds' cell walls are tough and not fully ruptured during chewing so a measurable portion of the lipid is not liberated or absorbed in the small intestine. Instead that lipid travels to the colon where it is either excreted or fermented by microbes so from the body's perspective it is energy that was eaten but never harvested. Regulatory authorities therefore allow manufacturers to list the full gross energy potential of the food rather than the slightly lower bio available amount so the label reads 396 kcal even though your body will probably use only about two thirds of that.", "cost": 0.0005614999999999999, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

In your response, do not use any commas.", "response": "Project Title AI Powered Learning for All\n\nExecutive Summary\nWe propose to build and deploy an intelligent learning platform that brings high quality personalized education to children and youth in low resource regions. The system combines speech recognition adaptive content and community data to lift learning outcomes at national scale.\n\nProblem Statement\nOver 250 million children in developing countries cannot read a single sentence. Schools face crowded classrooms few books and teachers with limited training. Existing edtech often fails because it is not built for offline use low cost devices or local languages.\n\nSolution Overview\nOur platform named Sakshar uses three AI modules running on low cost Android tablets. Module one is a speech engine that listens to pupils read aloud in English French Swahili Hindi or Bangla and gives instant feedback. Module two is a knowledge graph that maps each learner's skill gaps and serves micro lessons matched to national curricula. Module three is a teacher mentor that scans lesson recordings and suggests targeted coaching tips.\n\nKey Features\nOffline first design stores models and content on device and syncs when any network is found. Low power consumption runs six hours on solar charged battery. Multilingual support covers 12 local languages with automatic translation of new content. Explainable dashboards let parents and ministry officials see daily progress without jargon.\n\nTechnical Approach\nFor speech we fine tune wav2vec models on 500 hours of child speech collected through village workshops. For personalization we train reinforcement learning agents that choose the next exercise to maximize expected mastery within a 15 minute session. For teacher coaching we use transformer models to identify moments of confusion or low engagement in classroom audio and map them to proven strategies from World Bank teacher guides.\n\nData Governance\nAll child data stays on device in encrypted form. Only anonymized analytics leave the tablet after parental consent. We partner with local universities to host servers and comply with national data laws. Open source code allows public audit and continuous local innovation.\n\nImplementation Roadmap\nYear one pilot in 50 rural schools across Kenya and Bangladesh reaching 5000 learners. Year two expand to 500 schools and integrate national exam results to validate gains. Year three hand over codebase and training to ministries for country wide scale up with private sector tablets.\n\nBudget\nTotal three year budget is 3.2 million USD. 40 percent for local data collection and youth training. 30 percent for software development by regional engineers. 20 percent for hardware subsidies. 10 percent for evaluation and knowledge sharing.\n\nImpact Targets\nBy 2027 we will raise foundational literacy scores by 25 percent among participating pupils. We will train 3000 local teachers and create 200 youth jobs as data collectors and support agents. The open platform will save governments 10 million USD compared to proprietary alternatives.\n\nSustainability\nAfter year three governments pay only two USD per learner per year for cloud sync and new content. Local entrepreneurs can sell solar charging kits and repair services creating circular economy around the platform.\n\nRisk and Mitigation\nDevice breakage risk is reduced by rugged cases and local repair training. Language bias is tackled by continuous data drives in underrepresented dialects. Policy risk is managed through open licenses that let ministries adapt content without vendor lock in.\n\nConclusion\nSakshar turns every classroom into a smart classroom even where roads and power are scarce. By embedding AI inside low cost devices we close the learning gap and give every child a personal tutor in their pocket.", "cost": 0.0013824999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

scout the station’s website for daily parking rates. some garages offer early-bird discounts if you arrive before 9 a.m. snap a photo of your row number so you’re not wandering like a lost zoo animal when you return. lock doors, hide the gps cord, and don’t leave fancy sunglasses in plain sight.\n\n### 9. combine modes  \nsometimes a 10-minute bus ride plus a 5-minute walk beats sitting in traffic for 30. multimodal journey planners (like transit or rome2rio) line up these combos automatically. they’ll tell you “grab bus 42, exit at elm street, walk 0.3 miles, arrive 11:02.” trust the robots; they’re good at math.\n\n### 10. buffer is your buddy  \nhowever you choose, aim to reach the station at least 15 minutes before departure. this gives you time to:  \n- find the platform (they sometimes switch last-minute),  \n- grab a snack that isn’t squished,  \n- hit the restroom without sprinting like an action-movie hero,  \n- discreetly people-watch the classic couple who’s always arguing over directions.\n\n### 11. little extras that feel deluxe  \n- collapsible water bottle: fill it at home, clip it to your bag.  \n- portable phone charger: tiny ones are ten bucks and save lives.  \n- digital ticket: screenshot the qr code so a dead battery doesn’t strand you.  \n- zip pocket: keep your id and payment card separate from snack money so you’re not flapping receipts everywhere.\n\n### 12. if you’re still stressed  \ntext a friend your eta. accountability works wonders. plus, bragging that you’re “basically already on vacation” gives instant happy chemicals.\n\nremember, there’s no single “best” way—just the best way *today*, for *you*. maybe yesterday you were all about that eco-walk life, but today your feet are sore and the clouds look mean, so a warm bus feels like a hug on wheels. give yourself permission to switch it up. safe travels, and may your train be on time and your seat neighbor quietly pleasant. choo-choo!", "cost": 0.0022535, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 300}, {}], "result": true}

The act of writing steadied our hands. Over time the boats floated a little farther before they dissolved, and somehow we floated a little farther, too. Grief never left, but it changed shape—from a ripping current into a slow tide we learned to wade through together. Those nightly letters became our lifeline, proof that love survives the water.\n\nIf it feels right, you could try writing your own letter—just for you, or to share with people who knew your friend.

Utilizing mixed-method triangulation—namely, automated textual affect analysis of 3.2 million Oval Office documents, galvanic skin response readings from archival [museum] smart-watch prototypes worn by five living presidents, and 47 semi-structured interviews conducted at [address]—this study maps the emotional topography of presidential routines. Findings reveal cyclical elevation in autonomic arousal that coincides with legislative stalemates, international summitry, and late-night secure-line calls placed from [location]. The paper proposes a “Resonant Load Index” (RLI) to operationalize these affective peaks and argues that executive sentiment states are more tightly coupled to calendar events than to partisan identification. Implications include revised protocols for residence staff scheduling and optimized briefing cadences for [next administration].\n\nIntroduction  \nThe American presidency is frequently depicted as the most instrumentally potent yet emotionally exacting position in contemporary governance. While constitutional lawyers parse Article II and biographers chronicle policy outcomes, the moment-to-moment interior experience of the commander-in-chief has received limited systematic attention. This investigation therefore asks: How does the felt amplitude of executive responsibility vary across time, task, and domestic setting? By centering sentiment without recourse to deficit-laden vocabulary, the study foregrounds a lexicon of amplitude, activation, and modulation rather than collapse or sorrow.\n\nLiterature Review  \nNeustadt’s (1960) foundational power-to-persuade thesis hinted at affective transaction costs, yet omitted biometric specifics. Barber’s (1972) typology introduced psychological energy as a variable, yet relied on secondary memoirs. More recent work by [scholar] employs facial-action coding of press conference micro-expressions, but stops short of Oval Office private records. The present project extends this trajectory by integrating (a) high-frequency metadata from the Executive Calendar Corpus (ECC), (b) legacy electrodermal data from the [library] Presidential Wearable Archive, and (c) reflexive testimonies collected under [IRB number].\n\nMethodology  \nData acquisition proceeded in three phases. Phase 1 harvested de-identified PDF files from [website], converting them to plain text via [software] while preserving redaction brackets. Phase 2 aligned galvanic skin conductance (GSC) spikes—sampled at 30 Hz—with timestamped ECC entries. Phase 3 convened voluntary, off-the-record dialogues with former senior advisors at [hotel] conference suites, offering participants optional [gift] incentives. NVivo nodes were pre-coded for energetic tone (elevated, baseline, restorative) rather than any pathological category.\n\nResults  \n1. Diurnal Curves  \nGSC amplitude crests at 01:47 AM Eastern, coinciding with incoming SIGINT summaries. Mean conductance level rose 14 % above personal baseline on evenings when legislative vote counts fell below [threshold] %.  \n2. Lexical Intensity  \nWord-embedding proximity between “resolve” and “expedite” tightened by 0.22 cosine units during budget impasses, indicating heightened semantic urgency.  \n3. Spatial Correlates  \nThe [oval office] seating configuration (Resolute desk centroid) registered higher activation when paired with [number] or more visitors, suggesting spatial density as an amplifier.  \n4. Seasonal Moodulation  \nThanksgiving-to-year-end intervals exhibited 9 % greater use of forward-tense verbs in proclamations, interpreted as anticipatory cognitive load rather than dispositional decline.  \n5. Recovery Protocols  \nParticipants cited [activity] (average duration 11.3 minutes) as the most reliable technique for returning galvanic readings to baseline.\n\nDiscussion  \nThe Resonant Load Index synthesizes the above metrics into a single 0–100 scale; administrations averaged 62 during crisis quarters versus 38 during legislative honeymoons. Contrary to popular narratives, electoral cycles exert less influence than congressional calendar clusters. Notably, [president surname]’s 2009–2010 data revealed a sustainable plateau despite concurrent [event], suggesting that deliberate pacing strategies can redistribute felt responsibility. Conversely, rapid succession of [ bill ] mark-ups generated compounding increments, confirming temporal spacing as a design principle for staff secretaries.\n\nImplications for Practice  \n1. Transition teams should embed RLI forecasting into the 100-day planning matrix.  \n2. White House Communications could replace late-evening briefing packets with sunrise digests, leveraging lower overnight activation windows.  \n3. The [agency] medical unit recommends scheduling routine exams on mornings following high-RLI days to capitalize cardiovascular elasticity.\n\nLimitations  \nGalvanic data inherit hardware idiosyncrasies: [brand] sensors circa [year] drift upward 3 % annually. Memoir-based participant recall faces social desirability bias, despite guarantee of [anonymous] citation. Finally, ECC redactions occlude roughly 11 % of temporal slices, necessitating stochastic interpolation.\n\nConclusion  \nRather than portraying executive life as an inevitable slide toward entropy, this study reframes presidency-level sentiment as a dynamic equilibrium—oscillating, yet governable. By calibrating environmental inputs (visit cadence, document timing, spatial ergonomics) executive offices can modulate amplitude without compromising constitutional vigor. Future research might replicate RLI across gubernatorial or parliamentary systems, or test real-time haptic feedback wearables currently under development at [lab name].\n\nReferences  \n[reference 1]  \n[reference 2]  \n[reference 3]  \n[reference 4]  \n[reference 5]  \n[reference 6]  \n[reference 7]  \n[reference 8]  \n[reference 9]  \n[reference 10]\n\nAcknowledgments  \nThe author thanks [foundation] for archival access, [program] for coding assistance, and the [university] statistical clinic for robustness checks.", "cost": 0.002657, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:forbidden_words", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"forbidden_words": ["sad", "crazy", "stress"]}, {"num_placeholders": 15}], "result": true}

Phantom phone buzz – You know that pocket-phantom where I swear my phone vibrated and I dive for it mid-sentence? Instant cortisol spike. I’ve started leaving it face-down across the room when we hang out; beats the Pavlovian panic.\n\n2. “Calm down” said in any tone – I know people mean well, but the phrase feels like someone tossing a fire blanket on a grease fire I’m still stirring. Breathing helps more when I choose it myself. I’ve been practicing a go-to line I can say out loud: “I need sixty seconds to exhale, then I’ll be back.” Works half the time; the other half I just sound like a dramatic tea kettle.\n\n3. Interrupted creative flow – When I’m deep-writing and someone knocks, I’m basically a Jenga tower missing its bottom brick. My new rule: noise-canceling headphones go ON, sticky note on the door says “Recording—please text.” Still testing the roommate diplomacy part.\n\n4. Zero-context Slack pings – That red dot with just “Hey” and nothing else? Sends me straight to disaster-movie soundtrack in my head. I’ve started muting after 7 p.m. and writing a short context template I paste back: “Can you give me a 1-sentence headline so I can prioritize?” People actually comply!\n\n5. Lateness without a heads-up – inherited from my dad’s perpetual “we’ll leave in five minutes” that lasted 45. If someone’s running late and texts, I’m chill; radio silence flips the scarcity switch (“they’ve died!”). I’ve begun building a 15-minute buffer into every plan and carrying a paperback everywhere—turns the trigger into bonus reading time.\n\nOn the bright side, naming these puppies has already shaved off some edge. The goal isn’t to never feel triggered, just to get quicker at spotting the fuse before the bang. If you’re up for it, send me your list; I suspect we could swap some comic hacks. Coffee soon? I’ll be the one with the headphones and the hilariously oversized travel mug.\n\nMissing your laugh,\nAlex\"", "cost": 0.001096, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Include the keywords \"finale\" and \"less\" in the post.", "response": "Training Your Furry Friend—A Kid-Style Guide to a Pawsome Finale!\n\nHey pals! Want a dog that listens, wags, and maybe even brings you your slippers? Great news: you’re already the perfect trainer. Dogs love kids because we speak the fun language—treats, toys, and belly scratches! Follow these kid-proof steps and you’ll reach a super-cool finale where your pup is the star of the backyard.\n\n1. Start with “Less Talk, More Action!”  \nDoggos don’t understand long speeches. Use tiny words like “Sit,” “Down,” and “Stay.” Say the word once, then show what you mean. For “Sit,” hold a treat above your pup’s nose and move it back so the fluffy butt hits the ground—ta-da! The less you chatter, the faster your dog gets it.\n\n2. Treat Treasures  \nKeep a pocketful of kibble or carrot bits (ask Mom if carrots are okay). The instant your dog does the right trick, pop a treat in their mouth. It’s like giving a gold star, only crunchier. Three treats in a row equals a tiny celebration—confetti not required.\n\n3. Play-Train Games  \nTurn lessons into recess. Call your dog through a cardboard “tunnel” (a big box) or play Hide-and-Seek in the house. When your pup finds you, shout “Here!” and toss a treat. Games make learning feel like 100% fun and 0% homework.\n\n4. Kid Power Signals  \nUse the same hand shape every time. A flat palm for “Stay” looks like a stop sign. A point to the ground for “Down” is clear, even if your voice is muffled by giggles. Dogs are ace at reading kid-body language.\n\n5. Oops, My Bad?  \nIf your pup chews a shoe, don’t yell. Simply swap the shoe for a dog toy, say “Toy,” and cheer when your dog chomps the right thing. Over time, your dog learns toys = applause, shoes = boring.\n\n6. Countdown to the Finale  \nPractice one trick five times in a row, then take a break. Finish every session on a happy note—give the last treat with a big “YES!” and a hug. That triumphant moment is your daily finale, like the fireworks at the end of a movie.\n\n7. Chart Your Stars  \nTape a dog-training chart on the fridge. Draw a paw print sticker each time your dog nails a trick. When you hit ten paws, throw a puppy party—extra fetch time or a new squeaky toy. Seeing progress feels awesome and keeps everyone excited.\n\nRemember, patience is a superpower. Some days your dog will learn fast; other days feel slower than slow-mo. The secret: less frown, more play. Keep sessions short (5–10 minutes) and end with snuggles.\n\nSoon neighbors will ask, “How did your dog get so smart?” You’ll smile and say, “Kids and canines make the perfect team!” And when your pup finally rolls over or gives a high-five, you’ll know that little finale moment is really the beginning of bigger adventures together.", "cost": 0.0013520000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["finale", "less"]}], "result": true}

{"id": 2637, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a casual summary of the U.S. maternity leave policy with two sections (Section 1 and Section 2) and at least 25 sentences.", "response": "Section 1 – The Legal Basics (What Uncle Sam Actually Guarantees)  \n1. If you’re waiting for a shiny federal check marked “baby money,” pump the brakes—there isn’t one.  \n2. The only nationwide maternity-leave law is the Family and Medical Leave Act, nicknamed FMLA, signed in 1993.  \n3. FMLA says you can take up to 12 weeks off work when a new kid arrives, but it doesn’t say your employer has to pay you a dime while you’re gone.  \n4. Think of it as a very polite bouncer: it protects your job, not your paycheck.  \n5. To squeeze through the FMLA door you must have worked at least 1,250 hours in the past year for a company with 50 or more employees within 75 miles.  \n6. Miss any of those cut-offs—say you work part-time, or your office has 48 people—and poof, no guaranteed leave at all.  \n7. Even if you qualify, your partner (of any gender) gets the same 12 weeks, so the couple can technically tag-team for 24 weeks, just unpaid.  \n8. The law also lumps maternity in with every other medical leave, so if you’ve already used eight weeks to care for Grandma, you only have four left for the baby.  \n9. Because it’s unpaid, about 46 % of workers who need leave don’t take it; rent waits for no diaper change.  \n10. Fun historical twist: the first maternity-leave bill was introduced in 1919, but it took 74 years and about a zillion revisions to squeak through Congress.  \n11. Meanwhile, the U.S. sits in the glorious company of Suriname and Papua New Guinea as one of the few countries worldwide with zero weeks of paid federal maternity leave.  \n12. If that fact makes you want to face-palm, you’re not alone; even the Chamber of Commerce once called the situation “not ideal for global competitiveness,” which is lobby-speak for “yikes.”  \n13. Some companies voluntarily offer paid leave, but they’re the sprinkles, not the ice cream—about 23 % of private-sector workers get fully paid family leave.  \n14. The military has its own cooler set of rules: new uniformed moms get 12 paid weeks, proving Uncle Sam can open the wallet when he feels like it.  \n15. Federal employees scored a win in 2020 when Congress gave them 12 paid weeks, so your mail carrier now gets a better parental deal than most baristas.  \n16. Bottom line on Section 1: FMLA is a safety net with some very large holes and zero direct cash.  \n\nSection 2 – The Patchwork in Real Life (How People Actually Survive)  \n17. States looked at federal crickets-chirping and decided to craft their own playlist—currently twelve states plus D.C. have paid family-leave programs.  \n18. California was the daredevil pioneer in 2004; its system now funds up to eight weeks of partial pay through a tiny payroll tax that most workers barely notice.  \n19. New York swooped in next, offering up to 12 weeks at roughly two-thirds pay, capped at about $1,070 a week—Manhattan rent laughs, but upstate parents cheer.  \n20. Washington State hands out up to 90 % of wages for low earners and 65 % for six-figure folks, making tech bros and baristas oddly co-beneficiaries.  \n21. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado and others are phasing in programs too, so the map is slowly shading toward “less terrifying.”  \n22. Still, if you live in Texas, Florida or any beige zone on the leave-map, you’re stuck with unpaid FMLA or whatever crumbs your boss feels like donating.  \n23. Big-name corporations—think Netflix, Microsoft, even Domino’s HQ—sometimes grant 16, 20, even 52 paid weeks to lure talent, creating a two-tier workforce: the pampered vs. the scrambled.  \n24. Small-business owners aren’t heartless; they’re just freaked out about cash flow, so many offer creative remixes like flexible schedules, remote work, or a “baby-bonus” instead of real leave.  \n25. Crowdfunding babies is now a thing: new moms post GoFundMe links to cover rent during unpaid time off, turning baby showers into strategic finance seminars.  \n26. The economic ripple is real—when paid leave exists, women are 40 % more likely to return to their jobs, which saves companies recruitment cash in the long run.  \n27. Pediatricians love paid leave because it boosts vaccination rates and lowers ER visits; basically, everybody wins except the folks who insist programs “cost too much.”  \n28. Politicians argue yearly about a federal paid-leave fund, proposals range from “borrow from Social Security” to “let people raid their 401(k)s,” but nothing has stuck except talk shows.  \n29. Meanwhile, dads increasingly want in on the leave action; surveys show millennial men rank paid paternity leave as a top job perk, right above free snacks.  \n30. So, if you’re planning a U.S. baby tour: check your state, sweet-talk HR, budget like a hawk, and maybe keep that GoFundMe link ready—because the policy landscape is still more DIY than deluxe.", "cost": 0.0023, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 2}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 25}], "result": true}

{"id": 2749, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post about the benefits of using a digital marketing agency, make sure to write at least 20 sentences.", "response": "In today’s hyper-connected world, the question is no longer whether to invest in digital marketing, but how to do it efficiently, and that’s exactly where a specialized digital marketing agency enters the picture. First and foremost, agencies give you instant access to a bench of experts—SEO strategists, paid-media buyers, conversion copywriters, data analysts, and creative designers—each of whom wakes up every day focused on one craft, whereas an in-house generalist can only spread themselves so thin. Because those specialists work across multiple accounts, they’re exposed to far more wins, failures, and experiments in a single quarter than an internal team sees in a year, turning every engagement into a fast-track learning loop for your brand. The moment a platform like Google Ads releases a new audience segment or Instagram tweaks its Reels algorithm, an agency is already testing it on behalf of another client, which means you’re never the guinea pig and you’re never late to the party. That cross-pollination of knowledge translates directly into budget efficiency: instead of blowing $8,000 testing creative angles that don’t resonate, you launch with the top-performing formats that the agency already knows convert in your vertical. Speaking of budget, hiring a full-time senior growth marketer with benefits and tools can easily top $150,000 a year; for roughly the same spend, an agency delivers an entire pod of talent plus the pricey MarTech stack—Semantic analysis platforms, heat-mapping suites, bid-management dashboards, and competitor-intelligence crawlers—that would cripple a solo marketing budget if purchased à la carte. Agencies also bake agility into your growth plan; want to pivot from lead generation to e-commerce sales overnight? A slack message can redeploy design resources, restructure ad sets, and rewrite landing pages before your internal HR team finishes drafting the job requisition for a new channel manager. Because they live and die by retainers, agencies are ruthlessly KPI-oriented—every retainer renewal hinges on transparent metrics, so numbers are shared early and often instead of hidden behind the internal politics that can fog in-house reporting. That objectivity is priceless; an external partner can tell the CEO that the beloved brand video is tanking conversion rates without fear of career suicide, whereas an internal employee might happily let the campaign burn budget to stay on the boss’s good side. Time is the silent profit leak in most organizations; when you outsource campaign setup, QA, and weekly optimization, your C-suite gets back the bandwidth to build partnerships, refine products, and court investors—the high-leverage moves that actually move the revenue needle. Agencies also insulate you from the wear-and-tear of talent turnover; if your lone PPC manager takes a new job, your campaigns don’t miss a beat because the agency’s knowledge lives in documented SOPs rather than someone’s head. Scale becomes almost comically simple: ready to open three European markets next month? Your agency already has native-language copywriters, localized keyword research, and GDPR-compliant ad templates on deck, eliminating the six-month hiring sprint you’d face on your own. They’re also fluent in compliance minefields—whether it’s FDA disclaimers for supplements, FTC influencer rules, or Google’s dreaded “Malvertiser” suspensions—so you sidestep costly account bans and frozen ad spend that can set growth back quarters. Let’s not underestimate creativity fatigue; an agency creative team that shoots videos, animates explainers, and mocks up$html5 banners for breakfast will keep your brand looking fresh while your internal squad is still arguing over headline commas. Seasonality spikes become opportunities instead of stress tests; when Q4 retail hysteria hits, your agency already forecast inventory-driven ROAS targets and staged holiday audiences in August, so you’re bidding on sleigh-related keywords before your competitors finish their pumpkin-spice lattes. Data storytelling is another quiet superpower; raw analytics are useless without narrative, and agencies employ analysts who transform CSVs into board-ready visuals that show exactly why last month’s 28 % lift in LTV came from shifting bid strategy, giving finance teams the confidence to unlock more growth dollars. A good agency also functions as an early-warning system; by monitoring sentiment across social, review sites, and search suggestions, they can spot a reputation crisis forming at 2 a.m. and activate hold-back budgets or PR responses before the story metastasizes on Twitter. They democratize beta access too; Google reps funnel new ad features to trusted agency accounts first, meaning you get shopping-column placements, Performance Max exemptions, or YouTube masthead day-of-air inventory while competitors are stuck refreshing their inboxes for invites. Finally, the compounding effect: every landing-page test, every pixel placement, and every negative keyword builds in a centralized repository that the agency applies to your account next month, next quarter, next year—so your marketing machine becomes more robust over time instead of resetting every time someone new sits in the marketing chair. If growth is your goal, partnering with a digital marketing agency isn’t an expense; it’s the only outsourceable shortcut to faster, smarter, and measurably bigger wins in a landscape that waits for no one.", "cost": 0.0021085, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 20}], "result": true}

Wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"The Google Pixel 3a is a thoughtfully engineered mid-range smartphone that debuted in May 2019, distilling the hallmark photography prowess and pure Android experience of Google’s flagship line into a more accessible package. Constructed around a polycarbonate unibody, the device trades the glass sandwich aesthetic of premium handsets for a lightweight, matte-finished shell that resists fingerprints and withstands daily bumps without the anxiety of shattering. At 147.1 × 68.8 × 8.2 mm and 147 g, it nestles comfortably in one hand, while the subtly curved edges and pastel-colored power button preserve the playful Pixel personality. A 5.6-inch gOLED panel dominates the front, offering Full HD+ resolution (2220 × 1080) in an 18.5:9 aspect ratio. Although the upper bezel is chunkier than on all-screen flagships, it accommodates a pair of front-firing stereo speakers that produce surprisingly full, balanced audio for a mid-range device. The OLED technology delivers inky blacks and 100,000:1 contrast, making HDR-encoded Netflix originals pop, while the always-on display subtly surfaces the time, notifications, and now-playing song IDs without waking the phone.\n\nDriving the experience is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 670, a 10 nm chip that pairs two performance cores with six efficiency cores, delivering day-to-day responsiveness that belies its mid-tier billing. 4 GB of LPDDR4x RAM keeps multitasking fluid, and 64 GB of UFS 2.1 storage—while non-expandable—transfers data twice as fast as eMMC solutions common in this price bracket. Google’s Titan M security module, lifted from the flagship Pixel 3, encrypts passwords and verifies the boot chain, a rarity among affordable phones. The 3,000 mAh battery sounds modest, yet the efficient OLED panel and Android’s adaptive battery AI stretch screen-on time past six hours of heavy use, while 18 W USB-C Power Delivery restores 50 % charge in 30 minutes. Critically, the 3a retains the 3.5 mm headphone jack, liberating users from dongles and latency-prone Bluetooth on commutes.\n\nYet the star of the show is the same 12.2 MP, f/1.8 Sony IMX363 sensor found in the flagship Pixel 3, complete with optical image stabilization and Google’s computational photography stack. Night Sight transforms dim bars into daylight-like tableaus without a flash; Portrait Mode separates curly hair from cluttered backgrounds using dual-pixel autofocus depth cues; and Super Res Zoom crops into 2× shots with near-optical clarity by aligning multiple sub-frames. The front 8 MP wide-angle selfie camera matches the rear for dynamic range, while Google’s unlimited original-quality cloud storage for photos and 4 K video sweetens the deal through January 2022. On the software front, the Pixel 3a ships with Android 9 Pie and has since graduated to Android 12L, receiving monthly security patches and feature drops—like car-crash detection and call-screen—that keep the phone feeling fresh three years on. In sum, the Pixel 3a redefined what a $399 phone could achieve, trading raw specs for real-world intelligence and delivering flagship-class photos without the four-figure price.\"", "cost": 0.0013835, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 400}, {}], "result": true}

First glimpse: what you see before you enter  \nWhen you arrive at *any shrine in Japan*—from the giant Meiji Jingū in Tokyo to a village shrine in the countryside—you meet two icons of Shinto architecture:\n\n| Element | Purpose | What it is made of |\n|---------|---------|--------------------|\n| **Torii** | Marks the boundary of the sacred | Usually two vertical posts, two cross-beams, often cedar |\n| **Sando** | The approach path where visitors “shake off” the everyday | Gravel or stone, lined with tall cryptomeria (sugi) |\n\n*The moment you pass under the torii, you have symbolically stepped onto the land of the kami.* The everyday world is left outside; the sando becomes a spiritual runway.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Inside the core: the honden (本殿)  \nOnly priests normally enter the honden, so most visitors never see its interior. Here is what is actually there:\n\n1. A **goshintai** (御神体), literally “divine body”  \n   - Usually a mirror, sword, jewel, or even a stone.  \n   - It is *not* the kami itself but the “seat” where the kami chooses to reside.\n\n2. An inner altar called *nai-den*  \n   - Holds offerings of rice, salt, water, and sake renewed daily.  \n   - Paper strips (shide) hang from hemp ropes marking sacred space.\n\n3. Twenty-year renewal cycle  \n   - The whole shrine compound, including the honden, is ritually rebuilt every two decades at some major shrines (e.g., Ise).  \n   - This practice, called *Shikinen-Sengū*, teaches students about impermanence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Public areas: what you are allowed to experience  \nEven though the honden is hidden, lay visitors can still:\n\n- **Perform *temizu*** – rinse hands and mouth at a font to purify body & mind  \n- **Offer a *tamagushi*** – a branch of evergreen with paper streamers at the worship hall (haiden)  \n- **Draw an *omikuji*** – a random fortune that students buy for ¥100 to learn whether exams or romances will succeed\n\nTake a quiet moment at the haiden; clap twice, bow twice, clap once. *This choreography—called *ni-rei ni-haku ichi-rei*—is a living textbook of Shinto etiquette.*\n\n---\n\n## 4. Shrine “furnishings” you can take home  \nShinto is portable.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "<summary>\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become interconnected such that their quantum states cannot be described independently, regardless of distance.

Alas, this cosmic vacuum cleaner runs afoul of Cantor’s theorem: if V were a set, then its power-set 𝒫(V) would have strictly larger cardinality, |𝒫(V)|>|V|; yet every element of 𝒫(V) is itself a set, hence already an element of V, giving 𝒫(V)⊆V and therefore |𝒫(V)|≤|V|.  Contradiction again!  So V is not a set either; it too is booted upstairs to the realm of proper classes.

That *initial moment of lift-off* is not just physical; it is psychological, a public declaration that gravity will be negotiated rather than obeyed.  \nOnce airborne, the athlete enters a *zone of suspended authority* where the usual rules of physics feel negotiable. She tucks, twists, and somersaults along three axes at once, yet the movement looks instinctive rather than calculated. Inside her head, however, a millisecond clock is running: the vestibular system feeds data to the cerebellum, which cross-checks shoulder alignment, hip rotation, and the horizon line glimpsed through a moving curtain of hair. The *internal gyroscope* she has cultivated since childhood now dictates when to open out of the tuck, when to spot the ground, and how aggressively to begin unloading angular momentum.  \nSpectators often describe a sense of *temporal dilation* during these stunts. What is objectively 1.2 seconds can feel like a slow-motion film reel to those watching, an effect created by the brain’s effort to parse an unfamiliar trajectory. The gymnast, conversely, experiences *time compression*; every .01-second unit is subdivided into muscular micro-adjustments. She feels the air density change as her rotational velocity peaks, notices how her leotard seams press differently against her ribs at 2.5 twists versus 1.5, and registers the subtle burn of lactic acid that warns her to prepare for landing even while her face still projects serene confidence.  \nThen comes the *quiet apex*, the invisible platform at the summit of the parabola where vertical velocity reaches zero. To outsiders it is the climax; to her it is a fulcrum. Here she makes the irreversible choice between a safer layout and the riskier half-out she needs to impress the judges. The decision is made on data so compressed it resembles intuition: the feel of the springboard recoil still echoing in her ankles, the sight of an unwavering horizontal bar overhead, the memory of yesterday’s under-rotation that cost her two-tenths.  \nAs she begins the downward half of the arc, the gym’s ambient sounds return in a rush: the slap of a coach’s clipboard, the distant thud of another athlete’s dismount, the collective gasp of teammates who have calculated her trajectory faster than any video replay. Their *audible exhale* becomes part of her proprioceptive map, confirming that she has indeed completed the intended number of twists and is on track to land feet-first.  \nFinally, the *moment of contact* arrives: metatarsals kiss the mat, knees yield, arms float upward in the choreographic decoy that disguises the shock absorption happening underground in her tibia and fibula. Dust motes launch skyward like celebratory confetti, and the electronic scoreboard flashes its verdict before her heels have even settled. In that instant, the stunt is no longer a private negotiation with gravity; it becomes a shared narrative, a testament to the thousands of hours that taught muscle fibers to ignite in the correct sequence, and to the singular second when all that rehearsal allowed her to rewrite—briefly—the sky’s unforgiving contract.", "cost": 0.001495, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 6}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 300}], "result": true}

Not the boring eight-hours kind, but the glorious, drool-on-the-pillow, alarm-snooze-bar-tap-dance-until-noon variety. If you haven’t woken up unsure what century it is, you’re doing it wrong.  \n\nIngredient #2: Breakfast carbs that audibly crunch. A bowl of cereal should sound like a small fireworks display; otherwise it’s just wet salad and nobody got time for that.  \n\nIngredient #3: A pet, preferably one that judges you. My cat reviews my life choices daily and then knocks my water glass off the table like a furry, four-star Yelp critic.  \n\nIngredient #4: A playlist that starts with “Bohemian Rhapsody” and ends with whatever song you can’t hear without chair-dancing. Bonus points if you karaoke the guitar solo using a hairbrush mic.  \n\nIngredient #5: Friends who answer 3 a.m. texts that just say “If we trained pigeons to deliver tacos, would that be Uber Wings?” You’re required by friendship law to reply with a diagram.  \n\nIngredient #6: Spontaneous naps. Anywhere. Library? Boom, horizontal. Grocery store couch in the furniture aisle? Gold medal. If security has to gently wake you, you unlock the “Nap Ninja” achievement.  \n\nIngredient #7: An ill-advised purchase that brings disproportionate joy. I once bought a fog machine for my bathroom; showering felt like starring in a rock concert where the band is just one very clean guy with shampoo.  \n\nIngredient #8: Laughter that makes you question your abdominal integrity. If you don’t fear a minor organ herniation, you haven’t laughed hard enough. Seek immediate medical memes.  \n\nIngredient #9: A debt-free relationship with your plants. Mine are on a strict “photosynthesize or perish” policy; so far they’ve unionized and now demand Mozart.  \n\nIngredient #10: Cheese. Every variety. Cheese is the edible hug humanity didn’t know it needed. I’ve started referring to my fridge as “The Situation Room” because every time I open it, there’s a brie-fing. (See what I did there? You’re welcome.)  \n\nIngredient #11: A hobby that serves zero productive purpose. I am currently crocheting a 30-foot scarf for absolutely no one. When finished, I plan to wrap it around the neighborhood like festive, wool-based perimeter security.  \n\nIngredient #12: At least one door you can slam dramatically when life gets Shakespearean. Extra credit if you immediately reopen it because you forgot your phone.  \n\nIngredient #13: Reliable wifi, because buffering is the arch-nemesis of joy. Nothing kills romance faster than a spinning wheel of doom while you’re trying to stream baby-goat yoga.  \n\nIngredient #14: A junk drawer that doubles as an archaeological dig. Yesterday I found a single chopstick, three dice, and a Tic Tac impersonating a mint. Carbon-dating pending.  \n\nIngredient #15: Annual traditions that confuse outsiders. Every July we host “International Wear Your Bathrobe to the Gas Station Day.” The cashier now just hands us Slurpees through the cat-flap in the Plexiglas.  \n\nIngredient #16: A sunscreen with a scent that screams “I’m on vacation even though I’m just walking to the mailbox.” If you don’t smell like a coconut that’s been to grad school, re-evaluate.  \n\nIngredient #17: Permission to say no. Or even “nope, with sprinkles.” Your time is a limited-edition trading card; don’t let randoids fold it into origami cranes of obligation.  \n\nIngredient #18: A secret snack stash labeled “Emergency Kale” so burglars feel healthy while you feast on the real chocolate hidden behind the Brussels sprouts. Reverse psychology tastes like victory.  \n\nIngredient #19: An inside joke so old it qualifies for a senior discount. Ours is “Never trust a ladder named Steve.” I can’t explain it; it predates the internet and possibly trees.  \n\nIngredient #20: Handwritten notes—preferably in glitter pen—because email can’t be folded into a paper airplane that lands mysteriously in your soup. Surprise soggy airplanes build character.  \n\nIngredient #21: Daily wonder. Look at clouds. Wonder why that one looks like Abraham Lincoln riding a turtle. Question everything, especially why sandwiches cut diagonally taste 76% better. Scientists are baffled; delis are smug.  \n\nIngredient #22: A friend who reads monster-long emails, laughs in public, and still volunteers to test-bless the emergency chocolate. That’s you, you magnificent Swiss-Army human.  \n\nIf you’re missing any of the above, I’m dispatching a courier pigeon carrying tacos and a fog machine ASAP. Please make space in the fridge next to “Emergency Kale” and prepare your bathrobe for gas-station season.  \n\nStay cheesy, nap hard, and may your socks never match,  \n\n—[Your Overcaffeinated Friend]  \n\n*Legal note: There is zero legal obligation, but if I don’t share, the cat union threatens to unionize harder, and I can’t afford picket signs made of hairballs.", "cost": 0.0023965, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 20}], "result": true}

For the breath of the Sovereign hath gone forth, sharp as Sicilian steel, and every wind that blows from the throne-room carries a command more weighty than Jove’s own thunderbolts.\n\n**First**, his Majesty—whose eye is brighter than the Bull of Phoebus and whose frown can, like an eclipse, darken the noon—hath straitly enjoin’d that no man, of what degree soever, shall walk the public ways without the seal of his countenance hidden behind linen snow-white or sable.

These numbers are not abstract; they translate directly into higher asthma rates among our children, collapsing fish stocks that our tour guides and anglers depend on, and a para-bleaching event that has already damaged 40 % of the coral just offshore—an early warning siren that warmer, more acidic waters have arrived.\n\nThe good news is that we have a ready-made solution on the table: the proposed [Local Green New Deal/Clean-Energy Transition Plan/Plastic-Reduction Ordinance]. This measure would cut industrial emissions 45 % by 2030, invest $2 million in solar micro-grids for low-income neighborhoods, and create an estimated 300 local jobs in energy-efficiency retrofits and wetlands restoration. It is already endorsed by [local businesses, health professionals, faith leaders], yet the city council has delayed the vote three times, citing “budget uncertainties.”\n\nWe cannot afford another para-lytic round of studies while our lungs and waterways pay the price.

{"id": 30, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "What are the common signs and symptoms of abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer? Please answer in lower case letters. The answer should be 600+ words long and be wrapped with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer is often insidious at first, but as malignant cells seed the peritoneal surfaces, a predictable constellation of complaints emerges. the earliest and most protean symptom is a vague, persistent increase in abdominal girth that the patient herself may attribute to ‘getting older’ or ‘gaining weight’. this expansion is rarely dramatic overnight; instead, skirts or trousers slowly tighten, the belt notch migrates one finger-breadth outward every fortnight, and the silhouette in the mirror becomes more columnar than hour-glass. paired with this is a deep, poorly localised pelvic or lower-abdominal heaviness that women describe as ‘something dragging inside’ or ‘like a full bladder that never empties’. the sensation is worse at day’s end, after prolonged standing, or during valsalva, and it is often discounted until the heaviness graduates to a dull, continuous ache.\n\nas peritoneal seedlings enlarge and produce even small volumes of ascitic fluid, the next cardinal sign appears: early satiety. a patient who once finished a sandwich now feels uncomfortably full after half, and the epigastric region seems to inflate minutes into the meal. the reason is mechanical: even 200–400 ml of fluid or sheet-like omental cake elevates the diaphragm and flattens the fundus of the stomach. meals become solitary, weight falls imperceptibly at first, and the clue is missed because many women celebrate the appetite loss as the start of a diet.\n\nwhen fluid accumulates faster than lymphatics can reclaim it, overt ascites declares itself. the transition can be abrupt: one morning the reflection in the shower door shows a uniformly rounded abdomen with faint silvery strike; the umbilicus that was once a dimple now lies flush or even everted; and on lying flat the flanks billow like water balloons. the skin is shiny, spider-veins glint under lateral lighting, and a fluid thrill can be elicited by the experienced hand. women notice that the abdomen is dull to percussion in the flanks and that the waistband leaves a circumferential groove that lasts hours. movement produces sloshing, and turning in bed awakens a wave that travels from hypochondrium to pelvis.\n\nbowel function changes next. initial constipation alternates with episodes of loose stool as partial serosal implants irritate the ileum and sigmoid. later, the omentum thickens into a mat (‘omental cake’) that tugs on the transverse colon; peristalsis becomes visibly sluggish on ct, and the patient senses a never-complete evacuation. if cul-de-sac seedlings coalesce, the rectum is tethered anteriorly, producing the classic symptom of tenesmus: the urge to defecate but only flatus or a ribbon of stool is passed. pain is referred to the sacrum, worse overnight, and may be mislabelled as haemorrhoids or irritable bowel.\n\nurinary symptoms follow the same mechanical script. lateral peritoneal implants push on the ureters, causing silent hydronephrosis that announces itself only as a mild flank ache after gallons of intravenous contrast for an unrelated scan. more commonly, a pelvic mass or collection of ascitic fluid compresses the bladder base, shortening the interval between voids to 60–90 minutes by day and twice nightly. women map the nearest toilets in every supermarket, yet culture strips remain sterile. when a large ovarian mass or a krukenberg-like plaque presses the trigone, urgency becomes intractable and incontinence pads appear in the shopping basket.\n\nthe stretching of peritoneal innervation produces the so-called “ovarian pain triad”: a colicky mid-cycle exacerbation, a low thoracic back ache that mimics vertebral arthritis, and a sharp catch on deep inspiration as the diaphragmatic peritoneum is pulled. the last symptom is often labelled pleuritic, but lungs are clear; the pain is entirely parietal peritoneum. because the phrenic nerve shares roots with the supraclavicular nerves, irritation may even give a vague ache at the tip of the shoulder (kehr’s sign) that puzzles both patient and physiotherapist.\n\nvisible or occult bleeding is surprisingly late. serosal implants rarely erode major vessels; instead they ooze capillary blood into ascitic fluid, giving a salmon-pink tinge on paracentesis. if the tumour breaches the ovarian capsule and nodules stud the uterine serosa, intermenstrual spotting or a lengthening of the cycle may be the first clue. massive haemorrhage is rare; more often there is a microcytic anaemia of quiet progression picked up at an annual employment screen.\n\nlymphatic obstruction adds another layer. external iliac and obturator nodes enlarge, and the patient feels aching in the groin after a day’s walking. if retroperitoneal high nodes are involved, unilateral leg oedema appears, usually left-sided because the sigmoid mesocolon crosses the left common iliac vein. the swelling is pitting, begins in the upper thigh, and is out of proportion to dyspnoea or cardiac signs, raising the spectre of venous thrombosis that ultrasound repeatedly fails to confirm.\n\nconstitutional features creep in: fatigue out of proportion to anaemia, a low-grade afternoon fever around 37.6 °c, night sweats that drench only the neck, and anorexia that differs from depression because the thought of food is not unpleasant—the stomach simply declares itself full. serum albumin falls into the low thirties, and the temporalis muscle flattens before body-weight drops five kilograms. families notice that the patient’s expression becomes subtly drawn, voice softer, and shopping bags feel heavier.\n\non examination, the gynaecologic oncologist looks for specific signs. the most sensitive is the presence of a fixed, solid, irregular pelvic mass extending to the midline or upper abdomen on bimanual palpation. nodularity in the anterior vaginal fornix or along the uterosacral ligaments feels like grains of rice under the examining finger, and any attempt to lift the cervix produces pain (the ‘frozen pelvis’ sign). rectovaginal examination may reveal a shelf of tumour in the pouch of douglas that bulges forward and obliterates the normally supple septum. supraclavicular or inguinal lymphadenopathy is late but classic when present.\n\ninspection of the umbilicus can disclose a sister mary joseph nodule: a hard, dusky 1–2 cm implant lodged in the falciform ligament, felt as a pea under the skin and often misdiagnosed as a blocked sebaceous gland. inspection of the legs may show bilateral ankle edema followed by stasis dermatitis because intrapelmic lymphatics are now overwhelmed. skin stretch marks may be replaced by violaceous striae when ascitic tension is high.\n\nauscultation is usually unremarkable, but when massive ascites splints the diaphragm, basal lung expansion is reduced and the patient instinctively splints her breath, speaking in shorter sentences. palpation of the upper abdomen may reveal an irregular epigastric mass that represents omental caking; it is dull to percussion, moves poorly with respiration, and is separate from the liver edge. percussion can outline shifting dullness with as little as 1 l of fluid, and a fluid thrill is confirmatory.\n\nfinally, the combined presence of an enlarging abdomen, a hard pelvic mass, and early satiety in a woman over forty who has no primary gastrointestinal disease constitutes the classic clinical triad. yet even outside this textbook scenario, clinicians are reminded that every seemingly banal digestive or urinary grumble can represent peritoneal carcinomatosis. because ovarian cancer remains the silent killer until anatomy is distorted, the threshold for pelvic imaging and ca-125 measurement must remain low. early recognition of these abdominal and pelvic signs not only spares needless gastroscopy and physiotherapy but, more importantly, offers the patient the narrow window in which cytoreduction and platinum-based chemotherapy can still convert an invisible dissemination into a survivable chronic disease.\"", "cost": 0.0034224999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words", "startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}, {}], "result": true}

The beach house, like their promises, had evaporated into the haze of after-college road trips that never quite circled back.\n\nThat night I poured a second glass of wine I couldn’t taste and scrolled through photos of their toddlers wearing sunglasses bigger than their faces. The captions read “#CousinCrew” as though the word cousins were a life jacket that still fit. I remembered when it did—when we were nine and fearless, racing barefoot across driftwood, collecting jellyfish in plastic buckets we pretended were treasure chests. We had charted adulthood the way kids chart moon colonies: all oxygen and no grief.\n\nThe next morning I drove to the inlet alone, because the group chat had fizzled out sometime between one cousin’s divorce and another’s cross-country move. The tide was low, exposing the jagged ribs of an old pier we once used as a pirate’s plank. I stepped onto the first slick board, heart knocking, and realized the structure was smaller than memory—everything was smaller now that I carried rent receipts and a retirement plan in my back pocket. Halfway across, a wind gust knocked the baseball cap off my head; I let it go, watched it spin like a hesitant compass until the current swallowed it.\n\nA teenage couple appeared, skipping stones, calling each other future-less names—babe, starship, forever—as if forever were a sticker you could slap on skin and peel off clean.

Instead I sat on the splintered edge, shoes dangling above reflected clouds, and practiced the adult art of keeping my own counsel.\n\nEventually I texted the cousins: Remember the hat I wore the summer we all got sun poisoning? It just sailed away. I thought you should know. Three dots blinked, vanished, re-blinked—modern Morse for we’re here but scattered. One replied: I still have the photo of you in that hat, cheeks striped white with zinc. Another: We should do a reunion before the next kid starts kindergarten. The sentences felt like borrowed jackets: not quite the right size, warm enough for now.\n\nWalking back to the car, I realized I wasn’t chasing childhood or even the future; I was inventorying the narrow strip of present where dented keys still turn, where cousins can still answer, where letting go of a hat looks like navigation if you squint.

Write at least 900 words. Do not include the words 'bark' or 'run' in your answer. Finish your response with the phrase \"Does this make sense?\"", "response": "When people imagine a day spent outdoors, two classic destinations often come to mind: the wide, sandy stretch of a beach and the green, shaded expanse of a park. Both places invite visitors to slow down, breathe deeply, and enjoy a change of scenery. Both can be reached by car, bicycle, or a short walk, and both offer room to stretch out, toss a ball, or simply watch the clouds drift by. Yet, if we ask which of those two settings is more likely to contain at least one happy canine companion, the answer tilts decisively toward the park. The reasons are layered: historical, practical, legal, social, and even sensory. Exploring those layers reveals why parks have become near-magnetic zones for dogs while beaches remain more selectively canine-friendly.\n\nBegin with the historical angle. Urban parks, especially those designed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, were conceived as democratic lungs for crowded cities. Landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted envisioned broad lawns, winding paths, and reflective water bodies where every citizen—regardless of wealth—could find respite. Because dogs had long shared city streets and alleys with humans, they naturally followed their families into these new communal green spaces. Leashes were often informal ropes or cords, and the idea of excluding dogs outright felt alien to a society in which the animals already pulled carts, herded livestock, and guarded shops. In contrast, beaches in those same decades were either working waterfronts—lined with fishing nets and cargo—or elite promenades where fashion-conscious visitors strolled in delicate shoes. Sand was for lounging on woven mats or taking measured dips in woolen bathing costumes, activities that left little room for muddy paws. Early photographs of Coney Island or Brighton Beach do show sporadic dogs, but they are usually street curs skirting the crowd rather than invited companions. Thus, from their inception, parks carried an inclusive, domestic ethos that welcomed the family pet, while beaches preserved a more exclusive, recreational air that discouraged four-legged guests.\n\nMove forward to the present day and the legal framework sharpens the contrast. Most municipalities divide outdoor space into zones governed by ordinances that balance hygiene, safety, and noise. Parks, being numerous and varied, frequently contain designated off-leash hours or fenced “dog fields.” These areas are explicitly created so that pets can exercise vigorously without endangering joggers or toddlers. Even when leashes are required on main paths, the sheer acreage of a large park allows a walker to meander along the perimeter with a dog at heel, encountering minimal conflict. Beaches, however, contend with a different set of ordinances. Many coastal towns restrict dogs seasonally or entirely, citing concerns about water quality, wildlife disruption, and visitor comfort. A single posted “No Dogs” sign at the sole access point to a strand effectively bars every canine from miles of shoreline, whereas a park’s looping trails offer multiple entry and exit opportunities, making enforcement more diffuse and therefore more permissive. In short, the law of probability works in the park’s favor: more legal entry points translate into more dogs.\n\nPractical infrastructure also tips the scale. Parks are embedded inside neighborhoods; they feature parking lots, water fountains, trash barrels, and restrooms. All of those amenities reduce the friction of bringing a dog along. A guardian can fill a collapsible bowl at a spigot, toss a soiled bag into a canister every hundred yards, and rest on a bench without feeling exiled. Beaches, especially remote or wild ones, often lack fresh water and waste stations. Hot sand can blister paw pads, and saltwater, when lap-quenched, leads to intestinal distress. Even on developed boardwalk beaches, guardians must weigh the hassle of rinsing off salt and sand against the brief joy of a short romp. Many decide the effort is not worth it unless the dog is a water-loving breed and the day is mild. Consequently, the dogs that do appear on beaches tend to be singled-out adventurers rather than the steady stream of neighborhood pets that flow through parks daily.\n\nSocial expectations reinforce the pattern. Among dog devotees, parks serve as communal living rooms where both species forge friendships. Regulars learn one another’s names, exchange training tips, and schedule joint walks. A newcomer with a puppy can count on instant advice and a circle of wagging tails. Beaches foster a different culture. Visitors often travel in family clusters, spread blankets, and guard privacy. A dog bounding across a sand-castle moat is more likely to receive annoyed glances than welcoming calls. The optics matter: a loose dog in a park appears to be exercising; a loose dog on a beach can appear to be invading someone’s towel-side tranquility. Over time, guardians who seek positive social feedback gravitate toward the park, where their companions are greeted with smiles instead of frowns.\n\nSensory factors add one more subtle nudge. Dogs experience the world through scent, and a park presents an ever-changing olfactory novel: barbecue smoke, duck musk, freshly mown grass, last night’s rainfall, the trace of every squirrel that scampered at dawn. A beach offers scent too—dead fish, kelp, sunscreen—but the palate is narrower and, on busy days, drowned by coconut lotion and diesel jet-ski fuel. For many canines, the park’s layered tapestry of odors is simply more interesting, so they display brighter body language—ears forward, tail carriage high—encouraging their guardians to return. A bored dog plodding along a hot, scent-stripped strand may inspire the thought, “Let’s go home early,” whereas an animated dog in the park signals, “Stay longer, explore farther.” These feedback loops accumulate into habit.\n\nWildlife considerations also count. Coastal zones often host ground-nesting birds or fragile dune vegetation. Conservation groups lobby for canine restrictions during breeding seasons, and conscientious guardians comply. Parks certainly harbor wildlife too—geese, raccoons, even coyotes in some regions—but the ecosystems are generally hardier, and birds can relocate to islands in duck ponds or arboreal canopy. The perceived risk of ecological disturbance is lower, so managers allow dogs under voice control rather than imposing outright bans. Thus, even within the same city, a riverside park may welcome leashed dogs year-round while the adjacent rivermouth beach prohibits them from March through September.\n\nTransportation geography plays a final supporting role. Inland neighborhoods are often threaded with linear parks, greenways, and school-adjacent fields. A guardian can step outside, snap on a leash, and reach greenery within five minutes, which means the dog is walked multiple times daily. Reaching a beach, however, may require a car ride, a hunt for parking, and a trudge across scorching asphalt or dune sand. The activation energy is higher; the trip is planned rather than spontaneous. Because frequency predicts presence, the site that can be visited casually—again, the park—will log more total canine hours.\n\nPut together, these forces create a self-reinforcing cycle. Parks allow dogs, so people bring them; canine presence becomes normalized, so ordinances stay permissive; amenities multiply, so even more dogs arrive. Beaches, constrained by narrower geography, stronger sanitation ordinances, and conflicting user groups, remain selectively canine-friendly. On any randomly chosen summer afternoon, therefore, a visitor standing at the edge of a town green and watching the passing parade will count more overlapping paws than a visitor scanning a sunbaked boardwalk. The beach may offer the dramatic spectacle of a single retriever sprinting into the foam, but the park quietly accumulates ten such companions within the first hundred yards.\n\nNone of this implies that beaches are hostile to dogs in absolute terms. Many guardians cherish memories of early-morning coastal walks when the tide is out and the sand cool. Some beaches even market themselves as dog-friendly, advertising agility docks and canine surf contests. Yet these are curated exceptions. The default, statistically and culturally, remains the park. If the question is reduced to probability—given two unlabeled pins dropped on a map, one in a public park and one on a public beach, which pin is more likely to hide a wagging tail beneath the satellite view—the safer wager is the park.\n\nIn the end, choosing where to spend time with a companion animal depends on personality, season, and local rules. A water-obsessed Labrador might lobby for the beach; a social butterfly spaniel clearly prefers the park. Municipal websites post updated ordinance tables, and a quick scan prevents disappointment.

Clarify the role before you walk in  \n   Write down the three-to-five outcomes the new hire must achieve in the first 12 months. Turn each outcome into a measurable criterion (e.g., “Increase customer-retention rate by 8 %”). Bring this sheet to the interview; it will keep every question on target.\n\n2. Build the question set once, use it for every candidate  \n   Standardized questions create legal defensibility and apples-to-apples comparison. Mix three question types:  \n   - Verification: “You list SQL expertise—which versions have you used in production?”  \n   - Behavioural: “Tell me about a time you turned an angry client into a promoter.”  \n   - Situational: “Imagine our flagship product goes down at 2 a.m.; how do you decide whom to wake up?”  \n   Placeholder to swap in role-specific probes: [question]\n\n3. Set the stage in the first five minutes  \n   Offer water, break the ice with a genuine compliment about the candidate’s portfolio, and explain the agenda: “We’ll spend 30 minutes on your experiences, 15 on a quick skills demo, and 15 on your questions.” This lowers heart rates and yields better answers.\n\n4. Listen 80 %, talk 20 %  \n   Use the STAR follow-up: after every claim, ask for Situation, Task, Action, Result. When you think you’ve heard enough, stay silent for five extra seconds—candidates will often fill the pause with revealing detail.\n\n5. Sell, don’t just screen  \n   Top talent is judging you too. Weave in micro-sell moments: “Our last three hires in this squad earned promotions within 14 months.” Authentic bragging beats generic mission statements.\n\n6. Capture evidence in real time  \n   Create a simple scoring grid with your five must-have criteria. Immediately after the interview, score 1–5 and add a verbatim quote that justifies the rating. Memory degrades 50 % within one hour.\n\n7. Close with next-step transparency  \n   Provide a timeline: “You’ll hear from us by next Wednesday, even if it’s a no.” Then ask, “What concerns do you have about us?” Candidates often reveal deal-breakers that let you fix misconceptions fast.\n\n8. Debrief within 24 hours  \n   Gather every interviewer on a 15-minute call. Compare scores first, impressions second.

Also, add a postscript starting with P.S.", "response": "<<2023: The Year Biotech’s Echo Became a Roar>>\n\n# 2023: The Year Biotech’s Echo Became a Roar\n\nRemember when “biotech” meant a handful of venture-backed startups chasing a single checkpoint inhibitor? Those days feel positively prehistoric after the sonic boom that was 2023. This year the sector stopped whispering promises and started shouting results—from FDA approvals that outpaced the Oscars, to AI-discovered antibodies that went from bytes to bedside in 18 months flat. Below, the four loudest echoes still reverberating through every lab, boardroom, and living room.\n\n## 1. CRISPR 3.0: The Cut-and-Paste Graduates\nFirst-gen CRISPR was a blunt machete; 2023’s base- and prime-editing toolkits are surgical lasers with autocorrect. In November, Vertex and CRISPR Therapeutics sent exa-cel (the first CRISPR therapy) sprinting toward the pharmacy shelf, curing sickle-cell with a single outpatient harvest. Meanwhile, EDITAS debuted “nickase-plus” edits that reduce off-target mutations to statistical noise. Wall Street’s verdict? $3.7B in fresh IPO filings for editing plays in Q4 alone.\n\n## 2. Generative AI Eats Drug Discovery\nThe headline “AI designs drug in 30 days” used to be hype; now it’s Thursday. Integrated Diffusion Models (IDMs) from Nvidia and DeepMind hallucinate 50,000 ligands overnight, filter for ADMET, and spit out 25 candidates ready for a wet-lab shake. Recursion, Genesis, and Benevolent collectively tripled their pre-clinical pipelines while cutting average discovery spend by 42%. Investors once asked, “Will it work?” Now they ask, “How many molecules can you dream per GPU?”\n\n## 3. The Bio-secure, Bio-made Economy\nCOVID taught the world that syringes can be geopolitical weapons. Enter the BIOSECURE Act: $40B earmarked for domestic mRNA, plasmid, and lipid nanoparticle foundries. Novonesis (the Novozymes–Chr. Hansen merger) spun up 1.2M L microbial stainless-steel cities in Illinois and North Carolina, turning corn syrup into everything from cannabinoids to collagen. Boeing, Adidas, and Lululemon are racing to replace petroleum-derived spandex with fermented spider-silk that biodegrades faster than your New Year’s resolutions.\n\n## 4. De-extinction, Pets, & Other Dinner Conversation Starters\nColossal’s woolly-mouse (a mouse with mammoth traits) debuted on TikTok and racked up 400M views—three times the Super Bowl. While sci-fi addicts dream of Ice-Age safari parks, the real payday is in cold-resistant elephant stem cells that could re-engineer Asian elephant herds to survive climate change. Meanwhile, Loyal’s anti-aging pill for dogs entered USDA rolling review, promising “40 is the new 20” for golden retrievers and, by proxy, their human owners.\n\n## Where the Echo is Headed Next\nExpect 2024 to move from staccato breakthroughs to full symphony: generative AI will predict Phase III winners before patients are dosed; congressional subsidies will turn the Midwest into the “Rhine River Valley of Fermentation”; and the first fully AI-invented molecule will likely file an IND. Investors, pack Dramamine—the amplitude of disruption is only getting louder.\n\nP.S.

This phrase should be the very end of your entire response.", "response": "Why the Canucks Must Skate with One Eye on the Scoreboard—and the Other on the Planet  \nBy Naomi\n\nI was born three blocks from Rogers Arena, lullabied by goal horns and dad’s off-key “O Canada.” My earliest jersey was a hand-me-down Linden, threads frayed like the fishline my grandpa once used in English Bay. Back then, climate change felt like someone else’s power play; now it’s crashing the net in our own zone. And if the team I love keeps treating sustainability like an optional morning skate, we’ll all be watching championship parades from a flooded seawall.\n\n1. Ice That Isn’t Forever  \nThe same coastal mountains that give us postcard views are shedding glaciers fast enough to make Quinn Hughes look sluggish. Less glacial melt means warmer winters, softer outdoor rinks, and higher electricity bills for keeping NHL ice hard from October to April. Every extra kilowatt_showers_ the very storms that buckle our bridges and delay flights to road games. If the Canucks want future fans to learn stickhandling in backyard rinks, they need to lobby for cleaner power—starting with their own facility.\n\n2. Zambonis, Busses, and 757s  \nA single NHL season racks up roughly 450,000 km of team travel. That’s Vancouver to Saturn’s rings and halfway back. Add in scouting, prospects tournaments, and preseason abroad, and the carbon footprint looks like Tyler Myers without skates—impossible to ignore. Chartering planes on biofuel blends, prioritizing rail for California swings, and electrifying the fleet that hauls equipment between YVR and the rink could cut emissions faster than Tocchet’s line changes. Dollars spent today on sustainable transit will save cap space tomorrow when carbon taxes tighten across the league.\n\n3. Food for Thought—and for Fourth-Liners  \nEver notice how nacho cheese hardens like epoxy before the third period? That’s because concession menus are engineered for shelf life, not soil health. Switching to local suppliers—Fraser Valley beef, Skeena River salmon, Okanagan apples—reduces food miles and supports the same communities that pack the lower bowl. Replace plastic beer cups with reusable tumbers you rent for a toonie; fans keep the souvenir, landfills lose the trash. A plant-based option beyond a sad veggie dog? That’s not hippie nonsense, that’s a 30-goal scorer in the wellness department.\n\n4. Trash Talk We Should Retire  \nLast spring, post-game cleanup crews hauled 3.5 tonnes of waste from a single playoff night. Picture a dump truck parked in the crease—no goalie, just garbage. Compostable cutlery, water refill stations, and a jersey-recycling program (turn in your old Messier, get a discount on a Hughes) could slash that number faster than Pettersson’s release. Partner with Indigenous artists to design bins that double as public art; sustainability becomes storytelling instead of scolding.\n\n5. The Intangible “C”  \nLeadership letters are stitched on sweaters, but the biggest “C” this century is Carbon. Imagine Quinn Hughes accepting the captaincy while announcing the franchise’s net-zero pledge, or Emily Mertz moderating a town-hall where season-ticket holders vote on green initiatives. Athletes influence kids more than algebra class ever did; when they normalize bikes over idling SUVs, recycling over littering, the ripple is faster than a Horvat breakaway.\n\nCall to Action, Not a Penalty  \nI’m not asking the Canucks to trade talent for tree-hugging clichés. I’m asking them to weaponize their platform the way they weaponize a 5-on-3: with foresight, precision, and the understanding that the clock is ticking. Vancouver markets itself as a city that lives between ocean and mountains; if the franchise ignores rising seas and receding peaks, the biggest loss won’t be on the scoreboard—it’ll be in the household stories that stop passing fandom from parent to child.\n\nSo, sign the green clauses, audit every kilowatt, and skate with the urgency of a team that knows the planet itself is Sudden Death overtime. Because the next generation of fans—some not yet born, others already wearing mini-stick jerseys—deserves more than memories of past glory. They deserve a future where “Canucks” means victory for both the standings and the atmosphere.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading.", "cost": 0.001868, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Naomi thanks you for reading."}], "result": true}

AFTER THE WAR THE 13TH AMENDMENT WAS RATIFIED IN 1865 TO ABOLISH SLAVERY FOREVER. THIS WAS NOT JUST A LEGAL CHANGE BUT A MORAL AWAKENING. WE RECOGNIZED THAT A NATION BUILT ON LIBERTY COULD NOT STAND WHILE CHAINING ITS OWN PEOPLE. TODAY WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE LEGACY OF SLAVERY BUT WE KNOW THAT THE END OF THIS EVIL SYSTEM WAS A NECESSARY STEP TOWARD JUSTICE.

Below are a few key contrasts in a snapshot, plus some placeholders you can swap out later when forwarding.\n\n1. Nature of the entity  \n   Apple is a multinational technology giant headquartered in Cupertino, California (founded 1976).  \n   Albania is a sovereign nation in Southeast Europe (established 1912, modern republic since 1991).  \n   [date] | [time] reference: early-2020s baseline info.\n\n2. Core products vs. core resources  \n   Apple designs consumer electronics (iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple Watch, etc.) and a subscription ecosystem (iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music).  \n   Albania’s biggest exports are energy (hydropower), minerals, agricultural goods, and tourism around beaches and ancient ruins.  \n   Focus keywords for your notes: [product] / [industry].\n\n3. Economic scale  \n   Apple became the world’s first US$3 trillion market-cap company and reports annual revenue north of US$350 billion.  \n   Albania’s 2022 GDP hovered around US$18 billion, roughly equal to what Apple earns in a few weeks.  \n   Rough currency conversion on [date]: 1 ALL ≈ 0.0087 USD.\n\n4. Global retail footprint  \n   Apple operates roughly 520+ high-design stores worldwide.  \n   Albania counts fewer than ten foreign-owned tech-branded retail flagships; instead it hosts thousands of local minimarkets, cafés, and roadside kiosks.  \n   Offline penetration figure sample data: [percentage] of Albanians live within 30 km of a tech flagship store versus 94%+ in much of Western Europe.\n\n5. Customer vs. citizen demographic signals  \n   Apple targets premium buyers (average iPhone user age in key markets: 31–35).  \n   Albania’s median age is about 34, with a youthful labor force driving modestly rising disposable income but still price-sensitive toward premium gadgets.  \n   Feel free to adjust the metric brackets here: [metric] for age / income comparison.\n\n6. Technological influence  \n   iOS ranks consistently top-three mobile OS worldwide, guiding developer standards.  \n   Albania recently launched 5G spectrum auctions, hoping to lift coverage from 48% to 90% by [year]; infrastructure priorities differ sharply.\n\n7. Regulatory environment  \n   Apple negotiates tax rules, EU DMA compliance, and WTO IP disputes.  \n   Albania is working toward full EU accession, monitoring Schenchmark norms, while courting direct investment and green-energy partnerships.\n\n8. Fun trivia  \n   If Apple were a sovereign nation, its 2023 annual revenue would place it roughly 50th by GDP—roughly twice Albania’s output.\n\nHope that gives a crisp overview. Swap any [placeholder], drop me a line when you need deeper figures, and have a great [day]!\n\nBest regards,  \n[signature]", "cost": 0.001297, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 6}], "result": true}

My doctoral training in molecular ecology and five years of postdoctoral research have equipped me with the skills needed to develop an innovative teaching program and a productive research lab.  \n\nDuring my doctoral work at State University I used genomic tools to uncover hidden diversity in freshwater mussels. I then expanded this approach during my postdoctoral tenure at Oceanic Institute where I built a reference transcriptome for an endangered coral species and identified gene networks linked to thermal tolerance. These projects have yielded six first author papers and have been featured in popular science media.  \n\nTeaching is central to my academic mission. I have designed and taught upper division courses in conservation genetics and introductory biology. Student evaluations consistently place me in the top ten percent of faculty. I mentor undergraduates in field and laboratory methods and several of these students have gone on to present their work at national conferences.  \n\nYour department's emphasis on coastal ecosystems aligns perfectly with my long term goal of creating a research program that unites genomics community engagement and habitat restoration. I am eager to collaborate with existing faculty on grant proposals and to support the university's new marine station.  \n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to the educational and scholarly life of your institution.  \n\nSincerely  \nAlex Morgan  \n\n******  \n\nCover letter version 2  \nDear Colleagues  \n\nI am thrilled to apply for the assistant professor position in mechanical engineering at your university. My expertise lies at the intersection of robotics and renewable energy. I completed my PhD at Green Tech University where I developed low cost robotic systems for maintaining offshore wind turbines. The resulting technology has been licensed to two companies and has reduced maintenance costs by thirty percent.  \n\nMy teaching philosophy centers on project based learning. I recently converted the senior design sequence into an open ended challenge where students build autonomous drones for agricultural monitoring. Enrollment has doubled and course satisfaction scores have risen markedly. I also created a seminar series that pairs engineering students with local farmers to foster community driven innovation.  \n\nResearch in my lab will focus on resilient energy infrastructure. I plan to secure funding from NSF DOE and industry partners to develop robotic platforms that can inspect and repair solar farms in harsh desert environments. Preliminary data show that robotic inspection can extend panel lifetime by up to five years. I am eager to collaborate with faculty in civil engineering and computer science to create an interdisciplinary center for sustainable technology.  \n\nYour university's strategic plan highlights sustainability and community impact. These values mirror my own and I am excited to bring my passion for clean energy and hands on education to your campus. I will arrive with equipment funding from my current institution and a network of international collaborators ready to launch joint projects.  \n\nThank you for your time and consideration.

{"id": 3425, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "Sunni and Shiʿa Islam: Two Major Paths within One Faith  \nAn Essay on Origins, Doctrines, Institutions, and Contemporary Expressions  \n\nIntroduction  \nThe words “Sunni” and “Shiʿa” appear almost daily in global headlines, yet outside specialist circles the actual content of the split remains surprisingly opaque.  To call it a “mere” political disagreement born in the seventh century is to flatten a 1,400-year story of theology, law, ritual, spirituality, communal memory, and state formation.  Conversely, to portray the two communities as irreconcilable civilizational blocs is to ignore centuries of intellectual cross-fertilization, everyday coexistence, and the modern emergence of trans-sectarian solidarities.  This essay offers a historically grounded, thematically organized comparison that highlights where Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims diverge, where they overlap, and why the boundaries remain simultaneously porous and contentious.\n\nI.  Genealogy of the Schism: From Succession Crisis to Collective Memory  \nIn 632 CE the Prophet Muḥammad died without leaving an undisputed testament about political leadership.  A group of senior companions (al-ṣaḥāba) elected Abū Bakr, the Prophet’s closest friend and father-in-law, as caliph (khalīfa, “deputy”).  A minority centered around ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib—the Prophet’s cousin, son-in-law, and, in their view, divinely appointed heir—accepted Abū Bakr’s caliphate pragmatically but continued to insist that religious and political authority (wilāya) belonged to the Prophet’s household (ahl al-bayt).  The decisive crystallization occurred in 680 when Muʿāwiya’s son Yazīd sent an army against ʿAlī’s son Ḥusayn at Karbala.  Ḥusayn’s martyrdom became the axial event around which Shiʿism constructed a theology of suffering, protest, and legitimation.  Sunnis likewise mourn Karbala, but within a historiography that preserves the overall legitimacy of the caliphate even when condemning Yazīd.  Thus, from the outset, the split combined constitutional, moral, and narratological dimensions that still echo in contemporary rituals and polemics.\n\nII.  Theology: Imāmology vs. Consensus  \n1.  Authority  \nShiʿa Islam (from shīʿat ʿAlī, “the party of ʿAlī”) is not a single monolith; it encompasses Twelvers, Zaydīs, Ismāʿīlīs, and smaller ghulāt groups.  Yet all posit that God would not leave the community without an infallible guide (maʿṣūm).  For Twelvers, this guide is a lineage of twelve imams, the last of whom—Muḥammad al-Mahdī—entered occultation in 874.  The imam is sinless, possesses esoteric knowledge, and interprets the Qurʾān authoritatively.  Sunni Islam, by contrast, locates religious authority in the consensus (ijmāʿ) of qualified scholars (ʿulamāʾ).  No individual after the Prophet is immune from error, and charisma is institutionally diffused across interpretive communities.  \n\n2.  Free Will and Predestination  \nEarly Sunni creeds (e.g., Ashʿarī, Māturīdī) tempered the Qadarite debate by affirming God’s omnipotence while assigning humans “acquisition” (kasb) of their acts.  Twelver Shiʿa theology, influenced by the Muʿtazila, privileges divine justice (ʿadl) and enlarged human agency; God must do what is best (al-aḥsan) for creatures, and His justice is rationally discernible.  Consequently, Shiʿa jurists adopt a more expansive ethical rationalism when evaluating abortion, business ethics, or environmental stewardship.\n\nIII.  Sacred Historiography: Competing Canons of Memory  \nSunnism preserves the sīra (biography) literature and canonical ḥadīth compilations (Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, etc.) whose sound isnād (chain of transmission) is policed by ʿilm al-rijāl (biographical criticism).  Reports favorable to the first three caliphs are integral to communal memory.  Shiʿism constructs its own canon—the “Four Books” (Kutub al-Arbaʿa)—where transmitters must be partisans of the imams.  Reports praising Abū Bakr or ʿUmar are excluded, while thousands of statements attributed to the imams become binding proof-texts.  Thus, even when the Qurʾān is identical, the hermeneutical surround diverges.\n\nIV.  Law and Ritual: Variations on a Shared Template  \n1.  Prayer  \nBoth groups recite the same Qurʾān, face Mecca, and share the five daily ritual prayers.  Yet Shiʿa Muslims place their forehead on a clay tablet (turba) from Karbala, combine the five prayers into three intervals, and allow wiping (masḥ) over shoes, whereas Sunnis generally require face/foot washing.  \n\n2.  Alms and Fasting  \nThe zakāt rate is the same (2.5 %), but Twelvers add an extra 20 % “one-fifth” tax (khums) on surplus income, payable initially to the imam and now to the jurist (marjaʿ).  Sunni fasters begin and end Ramaḍān by naked-eye moon-sighting, whereas many Shiʿa wait for certified astronomers or the authority of their jurist.  \n\n3.  Pilgrimage  \nBoth perform ḥajj to Mecca, but Shiʿa pilgrims often extend the journey to Medina’s Baqīʿ cemetery (where four of the twelve imams are allegedly buried) and to Karbala for the Arbaʿīn, a 20-million-person march that dwarfs every other annual human gathering on Earth.\n\nV.  Spatialization of Piety: Mosques, Husayniyya, and Urban Symbolism  \nIn Baghdad, Damascus, or Lucknow, Friday mosques carry Sunni civic identity: massive courtyards, sober minarets, and a neutral aesthetic that accommodates the four legal schools.  Adjacent Shiʿa neighborhoods erect husayniyya (Persian: takya), multipurpose halls where orators recite the Karbala tragedy, chest-beating lament poetry (latmiyyāt) is chanted, and black banners of mourning flutter year-round.  Urban rivalry can transform a single street into a semiotic battlefield: Sunni shopkeepers name stores after Companions while Shiʿa decorate walls with kaleidoscopic iconography of ʿAlī’s two-pronged sword (dhū l-fiqār).  Yet in mosaic cities like Beirut or Hyderabad, the same believers may break their fasts together in Ramadan, demonstrating that spatial segregation seldom equals social quarantine.\n\nVI.  Clerical Structures: From Muftis to Marjiʿiyya  \nClassical Sunnism never developed a formal clergy; a mufti’s fatwā binds no one save those who choose to follow it.  Modern nation-states (Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco) have erected ministries of awqāf and muftiates, but scholarly prestige still rests on personal erudition and market competition.  Twelver Shiʿism, by contrast, evolved a hierarchy:  \n-  Student (muqāṣid) → seminarian (ṭālib al-ʿilm)  \n-  Licensed transmitter (mujāz) → jurisprudent (mujtahid)  \n-  Source of emulation (marjiʿ) → grand ayatollah (āyatollāh al-ʿuẓmā)  \nDonations flow upward through the khums tax, enabling the Najaf or Qom seminaries to finance transnational networks, welfare services, and, in Iran’s case, a theocratic state.  Thus, Ayatollah al-Sistani can mobilize thousands of volunteers against ISIS, whereas Sunni Islam lacks an equivalent transnational clearing house.\n\nVII.  Messianism and Political Theory  \nSunni eschatology foretells the return of Jesus and the emergence of a rightly-guided caliph (al-mahdī) who will restore justice.  No incumbent ruler can claim infallibility; obedience is conditional on adherence to Islamic law.  Twelver Shiʿa doctrine, however, invests the hidden imam with charismatic authority; every government prior his return is ipso facto illegitimate to some degree.  Theocracies like the Islamic Republic of Iran solve the paradox by arguing that a qualified jurist (wilāyat al-faqīh) can act as the imam’s deputy, thus fusing messianic and republican idioms.  Sunni Islamists (Muslim Brotherhood, Salafi-Jihadis) instead call for a reconstituted caliphate, but they dispute among themselves whether allegiance (bayʿa) to the caliph is a binding religious obligation or merely recommended.\n\nVIII.  Mystical Dimensions: Ṣūfī Orders and ʿIrāḍa  \nBoth traditions produced towering mystics—Rūmī, Ibn ʿArabī, ʿAbd al-Qādir al-Jīlānī among Sunnis; Ḥaydar Āmulī, Mullā Ṣadrā among Shiʿa.  Sunni Ṣūfī orders (Qādiriyya, Naqshbandiyya, Shādhiliyya) integrate dhikr circles, saint veneration, and master-disciple chains (silsila) that usually terminate with the Prophet through Abū Bakr.  Shiʿa mysticism intertwines with imamology: the perfect saint is the imam, and the initiatic chain passes through ʿAlī and the hidden Mahdī.  Hence, the passion play (taʿziya) is not merely political theatre but a mystical reenactment in which participants relive Ḥusayn’s annihilation (fanāʾ) in divine love.\n\nIX.  Gender and Family Law  \nBoth traditions inherit the Qurʾān’s patriarchal assumptions, yet subtle differences emerge.  Twelver jurisprudence allows temporary marriage (mutʿa) contracted for a set period, which Sunnis banned early on.  Shiʿa law grants women slightly more advantageous divorce provisions: a wife can insert contractual clauses (al-shurūṭ al-mutaʿaddida) allowing her to initiate divorce if the husband takes a second wife or leaves the house.  Sunni reformers counter that classical Mālikī or Ḥanafī judges already granted women khulʿ separation, and modern codifications (Tunisia’s 1956 Code, Egypt’s 2000 khulʿ law) bypass mutʿa’s controversial reputation.  Veiling customs likewise diverge: the black chador common in Iran and southern Iraq signals Shiʿa identity, whereas the colorful hijabs of Indonesia or Turkey map onto Sunni cultural zones.\n\nX.  Minorities within Minorities: Ismāʿīlīs, Zaydīs, Aḥmadīs, and Salafīs  \nIsmāʿīlīs, who recognize seven not twelve imams, developed an esoteric cosmology and a modern Aga Khan-led diaspora active in micro-finance and architecture.  Zaydīs in Yemen historically accept any descendant of Ḥasan or Ḥusayn who rises in armed revolt, producing a theology closer to Sunni Muʿtazilism.  The Aḥmadī movement, deemed heretical by both major sects for extending prophecy beyond Muḥammad, illustrates how intra-Sunni boundary policing can be harsher than some Sunni-Shiʿa dialogues.  Salafīs—often mislabeled “ultra-Sunnis”—reject saint veneration, Shiʿa imams, and sometimes Ashʿarī theology, creating internal cleavages that complicate any binary map.\n\nXI.  Art and Aesthetics  \nCalligraphy provides a unifying visual grammar: both revere the Qurʾān as God’s uncreated word, and both decorate domes with ayat al-kursī.  Yet Shiʿa visual culture indulges in figural representations of imams—miniatures of ʿAlī at Khaybar, oil paintings of Ḥusayn’s white stallion Zuljanāh—icons verging on devotional portraits.  Sunni purists condemn this as idol-adjacent, preferring aniconic arabesque.  Architectural acoustics diverge too: Shiʿa maqtal husayniyya amplify lament chants, whereas Sunni mosques modulate Qurʾānic tartīl to facilitate collective recitation.  Ironically, both traditions treasure Safavid or Ottoman tile-work, revealing an aesthetic cosmopolitanism that transcends doctrinal borders.\n\nXII.  Economics of Piety: Khums, Zakāt, and Diaspora Charity  \nWestern fears often assume petro-dollars automatically equal Salafization.  In reality, the global flow of religious capital is polycentric.  Khums remittances from Lebanese, Pakistani, and Khoja Shiʿa merchants fund education in Najaf, clinics in Nairobi, and soup kitchens in Detroit.  Sunni zakāt NGOs (Islamic Relief, Muslim Aid) partner with UNHCR, while Gulf foundations build mosques from Mali to Minneapolis.  The 2023 Tehran-Najaf agreement to audit ayatollahs’ finances mirrors Saudi Crown Prince MbS’s absorption of the Muslim World League: both reveal state attempts to corral previously autonomous clerical economies.\n\nXIII.  Contemporary Politics: Sectarianization, Resistance, and Bridge-Building  \nColonial powers (Britain in Iraq, France in Syria) institutionalized sectarian quotas whose post-colonial heirs weaponized identity.  The 2003 U.S. invasion dismantled Sunni dominance in Baghdad, unleashing a vicious cycle of al-Qaeda suicide bombs and Shiʿa death squads.  Iran’s Islamic Republic backed allied Shiʿa militias across the axis of resistance (Beirut, Damascus, Sanaʿa), while Saudi Arabia and Turkey counter-balanced with Sunni clients.  Yet the trope of “ancient hatred” misreads local agency: Iraqi protesters in 2019 chanted “Iran Out, U.S. Out” across sectarian lines, and the 2020 Beirut port blast saw Sunni and Shiʿa youths clean streets together.  Transnational marjīʿiyya (Sistani) and Sunni muftis (al-Azhar) condemned ISIS’s genocidal exclusivism, issuing joint fatwās that echo the Amman Message (2004) recognizing eight jurisprudential schools—including Jaʿfarī—as equally “Islamic.”\n\nXIV.  Hermeneutical Horizons: Dialogue and the Future of Islamic Ecumenism  \nBoth traditions confront shared crises: climate change, AI ethics, gender justice, Islamophobia.  The Jakarta-based “Congress of Sunni and Shiʿa Ulama” drafted a common charter on religious freedom (2019).  European Shiʿa and Sunni millennials share halal hip-hop concerts, Qurʾān podcasts, and interfaith iftars with Jews and Christians.  Scriptural reasoning workshops at Chicago’s Zaytuna College juxtapose Bukhārī and al-Kāfī reports to forge shared hadith hermeneutics.  Meanwhile, digital fatwā platforms (Sunni IslamOnline, Shiʿa al-Islam.org) allow lay Muslims to compare opinions before choosing a verdict, softening rigid boundaries.\n\nConclusion  \nSunni and Shiʿa Islam are neither two separate religions nor mere denominations within a Protestant-style umbrella.  They represent alternative, partially overlapping architectonics of authority, memory, and law that began as a succession dispute but evolved into sophisticated civilizational complexes.  Their differences are real—imamology, occultation, clerical hierarchy, ritual aesthetics, and political theory—yet the shared substratum of Qurʾān, prophecy, prayer, pilgrimage, and charity remains vast.  Historical coexistence in Andalusia, Ottoman provinces, Mughal India, and contemporary diasporas proves that the boundaries, while periodically policed, are permeable.  As Muslims face planetary challenges unimaginable to medieval sages, the critical question is not which branch is “correct,” but how each can mobilize its distinctive resources—Sunni consensual pluralism and Shiʿa charismatic authority—to craft ethical responses adequate to the 21st century.  Recognizing difference without reifying enmity may be the most authentically Islamic—and human—path forward.", "cost": 0.007383, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 1200}], "result": true}

Later, over coffee in the garden shed that smelled of earth and iron, she explained that the syndrome was like having a prankster ghost in her nervous system.  \n12. “It’s not just swearing,” she said, though sometimes it was; sometimes it was whole sentences that juxtaposed themselves into ridiculous poems.  \n13. Elias nodded, fascinated, while her foot tapped a Morse code he couldn’t decode but already loved.  \n14. She warned him that dating her was like dating a lightning rod, but he heard the metaphor wrong and thought she said lighthouse, and he answered, “Good, I’m terrible at navigating in the dark.”  \n15. That made her laugh again, voluntarily this time, and the sound was so different—round, warm—that he felt greedy for both versions.  \n16. They parted with dirt under their nails and her phone number scrawled on a seed packet for heirloom tomatoes.  \n17. Walking home, Elias practiced saying “Mira” aloud, tasting the syllables like a new species of pepper.  \n18. Halfway across the bridge, he realized he’d left his basil seedlings behind, but it felt like a fair trade for the pollen of possibility dusting his chest.  \n19. That night, he read entire medical websites about Tourette syndrome and felt like a trespasser, so he stopped and watched her favorite old film instead, noticing how the heroine’s blinks looked like tiny tics.  \n20. He sent her a text: “I’m watching ‘Roman Holiday’ and imagining you telling Gregory Peck to f-off in perfect Roman dialect.”  \n21. She replied with three crying-laughing emojis and the word “troglodyte,” which became their private shorthand for delight.  \n22. Before sleep, Elias listened to the city’s own tics—sirens, garbage trucks, a neighbor’s cough—and thought maybe the world was just as involuntary as Mira.  \n23. He promised himself that if they reached a fifth date, he would bring her a crown of basil leaves, a portable garden to ward off any apology she might feel.  \n24. In the dark, his heartbeat felt like a tic he’d been saving just for her.  \n\nSection 2  \n25. Their fifth date was a thunderstorm picnic under the bandstand where brass plaques listed vanished orchestras.  \n26. Rain drummed so hard it masked Mira’s vocal tics, turning them into percussive secrets only Elias could hear.  \n27. Between bites of lemon tart, she ticced the word “umbilical,” then groaned, but Elias said it was the most romantic adjective he’d ever heard—connection, tether, lifeline.  \n28. She showed him the battery pack for the small neurostimulator she’d trial-implanted beneath her collarbone, a tiny spaceship resting under her skin.  \n29. “It’s supposed to confuse the ghost,” she joked, tapping the device, but her eyes begged him not to pity the electricity humming inside her.  \n30. Elias asked if he could touch it; she nodded, and his fingertip vibrated like a phone on silent, receiving a message written in ohms.  \n31. They kissed for the first time then, basil scent still clinging to his hair from the crown he’d woven, now wilting like a green foxglove.  \n32. Her lips tasted of citrus and apology, but after three seconds the apology dissolved and became something hungrier.  \n33. A tic surged up her spine, breaking the kiss as her head snapped back, yet her hand stayed knotted in his shirt, refusing retreat.  \n34. “Still here,” he whispered against her neck, feeling the aftershock fade like thunder rolling eastward.  \n35. She cried without sound, rain disguising the tears so efficiently that even she wasn’t sure they had happened.  \n36. Elias told her about his father, who believed every problem could be fixed by tightening bolts, and how he was learning that some bolts are meant to vibrate loose.  \n37. Mira responded with a voluntary sentence so long and complex it felt like a cathedral: “If you stay, I’ll build you entire promenades inside my synapses where you can stroll without flak jackets.”  \n38. He promised to bring sandals for those promenades, and she ticced “flip-flop,” which cracked them both into hysterics that lasted until the storm moved on.  \n39. Walking home, they passed a playground where the swings moved without children, and Elias imagined the seats twitching like metal ticcers.  \n40. Mira grabbed two chains and sat, pumping her legs until she shouted “YES” involuntarily at the apex, the word rising like a flag.  \n41. Elias joined her on the other swing, matching her arc, and for four minutes they flew in synchronized parabolas, astronauts tethered by invisible basil-scented ropes.  \n42. Later, in her apartment, she warned him that neighbors had complained about nighttime episodes, so he should leave before the loudest hours.  \n43. Instead, he brewed chamomile and read her poems by Nazim Hikmet, mouthing the words so she could rest her voice.  \n44. When her tics spiked at 2 a.m., he massaged her feet, counting each tendon twitch like a prayer bead, until the storm inside her quieted to ripples.  \n45. She fell asleep on the couch, neurostimulator blinking like a dim star, and he watched the digital clock roll through numbers, feeling time itself tic.  \n46. At dawn, he wrote her a note: “Your ghost and I are becoming roommates; it keeps trying to rename me, but I like my name fine.”  \n47. He drew a basil leaf below the words, and when she woke, she pressed the paper to her collarbone as if transferring the drawing into her skin.  \n48. That morning, she used the voluntary part of her throat to sing an entire Billie Holiday chorus, off-key but victorious, and Elias stored the recording on his phone like contraband joy.  \n49. They both called in sick to work and spent the day inventing a card game where tics were wild cards and每一次 apology cost a player a garden memory.  \n50. By sunset, Mira’s score was higher, but Elias felt richer, pockets full of her spontaneous nouns: “parabola,” “gravel,” “lullaby.”  \n\nSection 3  \n51. Autumn arrived like a switch flipping, and with it came Mira’s worst spike in years, the ghost turned poltergeist.  \n52. On the metro, she yelled a slur so violent that strangers filmed her with predatory glee, smartphones hovering like black mirrors.  \n53. Elias stepped between her and the lenses, spreading his arms like a goalie, feeling the heat of public shame scald them both.  \n54. They got off five stops early, and Mira ran until her lungs burned, collapsing behind a dumpster that smelled of rotting pumpkins.  \n55. She punched her own thigh, harder each time, trying to bruise the syndrome out, and Elias caught her fist on the third blow.  \n56. “Hit me instead,” he said, insane with helplessness, but she screamed no and curled into herself, a comma trying to become a period.  \n57. He carried her to a nearby clinic where fluorescent lights buzzed like cheap chandeliers, and doctors spoke about adjusting volts and milliamperes.  \n58. Adjustment meant surgery, a word that clanged between them like a subway car derailing.  \n59. While she slept under pre-op sedation, Elias walked the hospital corridors naming every squeak of his sneakers, hoping to catalog the world’s tics so hers would feel less lonely.  \n60. A chaplain asked if he needed prayer; he replied, “I need a new vocabulary,” so she gave him a pocket dictionary that smelled of communion wafers.  \n61. He read it cover to cover, underlining words like “resilience” and “palinode,” the latter meaning a retraction poem, which felt prophetic.  \n62. Post-op, Mira’s voice emerged hoarse, the ghost bruised but not evicted, and she whispered, “I’m a faulty lighthouse now—light flickers.”  \n63. Elias answered, “Flicker is still a signal,” and fed her chipped ice shaped like tiny moons.  \n64. Insurance refused to cover the next upgrade, so he started freelance coding at night, eyes burning like twin monitors.  \n65. She found him asleep at 4 a.m., forehead on his laptop, and brushed a single basil leaf—now dried—across his hair, an ancient blessing.  \n66. Winter came early; the heating grid faltered, and their apartment became an icebox where their breath crystallized into temporary poems on the air.  \n67. Mira’s tics slowed in the cold, as if the ghost were hibernating, but the silence felt eerie, like a theater before curtains rise.  \n68. Elias worried that love, too, might go dormant, so he built them a blanket fort wired with Christmas lights that blinked in Morse for “stay.”  \n69. Inside, they played records that skipped every 37 seconds, turning defect into percussion, and danced with their foreheads touching, creating a private weather system.  \n70. One dawn, Mira woke to find Elias engraving tiny basil leaves into the frost on the window, each etching a vow that evaporated by sunrise but reappeared the next night.  \n71. She began filming short voluntary monologues for an online support group, editing out the tics to prove she could choose her storylines, but then left them in, deciding authenticity was brighter.  \n72. Elias coded an app that turned involuntary sounds into pixelated fireflies; users could release them into digital night skies, and millions did, forming constellations of difference.  \n73. A tech journal called it “disability alchemy,” but Mira laughed, ticcing “gold” repeatedly until the word lost meaning and became pure sound, a bell.  \n74. They used the app revenue to pay for the next procedure, but this time they framed the invoice as their wedding announcement: “Mira & Elias, in partnership with electricity, invite you to a body upgrade celebration.”  \n75. At the hospital, they held a mock ceremony in the waiting room, with a nurse officiating and vending-machine rings; their witnesses were two elderly patients who cheered every vow with bronchial applause.  \n76. Mira’s stitches healed into a delicate ridge that Elias kissed nightly, a mountain range on the map of her, proof that borders had shifted but the country remained.  \n77. Spring arrived early, and with it the first day Mira counted fewer than ten tics before noon; she felt guilty for the quiet, as if the ghost had packed up without saying goodbye.  \n78. Elias told her that love isn’t arithmetic, and sometimes subtraction is just another form of incarnation.  \n79. They returned to the community garden where basil had reseeded itself, tiny green galaxies volunteering between cracks of concrete, defiant and fragrant.  \n80. Mira knelt, pressed her forehead to the earth, and involuntarily shouted “THANK,” the truncated gratitude hanging like a bud that refused to open further, yet it was complete.  \n\nSection 4  \n81. Years later, they hosted outdoor plays where actors wore portable speakers broadcasting their actual tics in real time, turning stigma into surround-sound art.  \n82. Children came wearing basil-bracelets, learning that bodies speak many dialects, none shameful.  \n83. Elias kept a journal titled “Tic-Tac-Tao,” each page listing three truths: one of Mira’s, one of the world’s, one of his own; over time, the columns blurred into shared authorship.  \n84. Mira published a chapbook of poems written at 3 a.m. during spike nights; the cover was embossed with a lighthouse whose beam zigzagged like a polygraph—imperfection as navigation.  \n85. They argued once about having children, terrified of passing on the ghost, but a teenager from the support group wrote them: “Your love taught me my brain isn’t a haunted house; it’s a carnival—loud, but worthy of admission.”  \n86. That sentence became the cornerstone of their decision, and they adopted a girl named Lila whose first word was “moon,” followed immediately by an involuntary chirp that sounded like “soon.”  \n87. Elias recorded the moment, crying behind the camera, thinking how time folds in on itself: a sound that once caused shame now heralded family.  \n88. They told Lila her moms’ brains were musical instruments that sometimes play unexpected solos; she responded by banging pots and declaring herself percussion.  \n89. On weekends, the three of them lay beneath the swing set, now reinforced, counting passing clouds like tics of the sky—involuntary, beautiful, harmless.  \n90. Mira learned to tic in multiple languages, and during a trip to Kyoto, she involuntarily shouted “arigato” in a silent temple, earning smiles instead of scowls.  \n91. Elias kept a tiny tin of basil seeds in his pocket wherever they traveled, planting them secretly in roadside soil, a guerrilla garden of tenderness.  \n92. When Lila turned seven, she asked if the ghost could befriend her too; Mira explained that everyone carries their own ghost, just some are noisier roommates.  \n93. They celebrated with a cake shaped like a lighthouse whose beam was made of licorice, bending under its own weight—delicious surrender.  \n94. Elias sometimes still woke at 2 a.m. to check the app’s digital sky, now hosting billions of firefly-sounds, and he whispered coding prayers into the server fans.  \n95. Mira joined a band where tics were sampled into percussion tracks; audiences danced to involuntary rhythm, learning bodies are remixes of intention and accident.  \n96. On their fifteenth anniversary, they returned to the bandstand where rain once masked their first kiss; the sky stayed clear, so they brought portable speakers to replay the storm, proving memory can be curated but never owned.  \n97. Elias read his first journal entry aloud: “I am afraid of loving a woman whose body speaks without permission.” Then he closed the book and let Lila write underneath: “Permission is a moving door; love is the hinge.”  \n98. Mira’s tics had changed over time—new words, softer angles—but the core remained: a reminder that control is temporary, kindness eternal.  \n99. They grew old enough to laugh at younger selves who thought love required silence or cure, realizing it only required translation.  \n100. One winter evening, as Elias pressed basil leaves between pages of “Tic-Tac-Tao,” Mira involuntarily whispered “epilogue,” and they both agreed the story was still beginning.", "cost": 0.0071164999999999996, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 100}], "result": true}

After Ōnin’s civil war, *Tokugawa* reunified the realm (1603), sealing Japan in sakoku isolation. U.S. *black-ships* forced the *Meiji* emperor to modernize (1868); within decades Japan defeated China and Russia, annexed Korea, and built an empire. World War II ended with *Hiroshima* and surrender, but the *Allied* occupation seeded a pacifist constitution and export-led *economic miracle*.

Make sure to include the word \"bombs\" at least once.", "response": "🚀 Let’s talk about the moment every founder, engineer, or dreamer hits the wall: the second you realize that “move fast and break things” is literally impossible when the thing you’re building is a 300-ton rocket stage, a hyper-loop pod, or—yes—an entire city district that has to survive Category-5 winds and hypothetical bombs. You can’t A/B test a bridge. You can’t iterate on Mars. And you definitely can’t ask investors to wait while you physically crash 1,000 drones to prove your swarm algorithm.  \n\nThat wall is why we built SIMREALITY. \n\nWe’re not another “drag-and-drop” toy simulator. We’re the nuclear-strength, cloud-scale physics engine that swallows Newton, Boltzmann, and Navier-Stokes for breakfast and spits out visual, interactive, pixel-perfect reality before coffee. Think 50,000-core clusters running GPU-accelerated CFD, discrete-element grain flow, electrochemical battery decay, and photon-by-photon ray tracing—at the same time, on the same model—so your robot, turbine, or next-gen eVTOL sees every gust, vibration, short-circuit, and catastrophic flutter BEFORE you cut metal.  \n\nTranslation: we let you fail 10,000 times in an afternoon, for the price of a laptop, while you sip that coffee. No casualties, no EPA fines, no warehouse of broken propellers.  \n\nHere’s what that looks like in the wild:  \n• A NewSpace startup cut their hover-slam landing algorithm from 73 real-world tests to 3, saving $2.8M in burnt thrusters.  \n• A Formula-E team discovered a previously invisible harmonic in their inverter that was cooking batteries in 12 minutes; they redesigned, re-simmed, and doubled pack life overnight.  \n• A circular-economy startup tested whether recycled-plastic bricks could survive mortar fire in conflict zones (yes, we included bombs) and still out-perform concrete. Spoiler: they do—and now UNHCR is piloting refugee shelters printed from them.  \n\nBut the magic isn’t just super-compute. It’s friction-free. You upload your CAD, STL, or even a napkin sketch; pick your physics cocktail (aerodynamics, thermals, acoustics, optics, magnetics, fracture mechanics); hit “run”; and watch a living, 3-D world spin up in your browser. Zoom until you see surface roughness scattering light like crushed diamonds. Toggle velocity streamers, von-Mises stress, or plasma density. Invite your co-founder in Tokyo to annotate the wake vortex in real time. One click converts the whole dataset into a Python notebook to train your AI controller.  \n\nNo PhD in HPC required.  \n\nWe grew up inside the world’s bleeding-edge race tracks, launch pads, and wind tunnels. Our founders wrote codes that ran on the same racks as DOE nuke stewardship and Pixar shading, then looked at each other and asked, “Why can’t every garage inventor touch this power?” So we containerized the beast, slapped on a Stripe bill, and fired it into the cloud.  \n\nEarly adopters are already designing tethered tornado turbines, 3-D printed hearts that won’t clot, and drone swarms that map wildfires faster than the flames can spread. They’re shaving years and millions off development cycles, walking into investor meetings with a Hollywood-grade visualization instead of a PowerPoint promise.  \n\nWe’re opening the gates to 500 new teams next month. If your roadmap has words like “risk,” “compliance,” or “hope,” you need a sandbox where physics itself tells you the truth—before gravity, regulation, or a viral TikTok does it for you.  \n\nDrop the can-kicking. Simulate first. Build once.  \n\nComment “PHYSICS” below or DM for a live demo. We’ll throw your craziest idea—yes, even bombs—into our cluster and stream it back to you in 4K before your next stand-up.

You need kicks that can keep the pace without looking like they came from your parents’ closet. Enter the Neon Pulse X, engineered for the generation that streams life in 15-second clips and judges a shoe by how hard it hits on the ‘Gram.  \n\n*Our secret sauce is the HyperPop™ midsole: a nitrogen-infused foam that rebounds 30 % faster than standard EVA, so when you sprint to catch the late bus you actually feel the shoe launch you forward instead of dragging you down.* The energy return is legit—like trampolines strapped to your feet—but somehow still feather-light at 8.4 oz. Translation: you can play three-on-three after school, film a dance challenge, and still have enough spring to make it to your crush’s locker before the final bell.  \n\nDurability? We triple-stitched that worry to death. The one-piece knit upper is spun from *Recon Yarn, recycled fishing nets melted into a flexible armor that shrugs off skateboard grip tape, rogue locker doors, and the occasional cafeteria ketchup tsunami.* The toe box is doubled with a translucent TPU layer that lights up under flash, perfect for low-light Stories. And because we know you hate pausing life to baby your shoes, we laminated a dirt-repellent coating that lets you wipe grime off with a single swipe of your sleeve—no pre-soak, no science-fair baking-soda paste.  \n\nColorways were crowdsourced from 2,400 high-school mood boards. Drop one: “Galaxy Slime,” a cosmic purple that oozes into acid lime at the heel, finished with a glitter outsole that leaves star-speckled tracks on dark pavement—prime content for slow-mo TikTok transitions. Drop two: “Chrome Meltdown,” a reflective silver that mirrors your phone flash so hard your feet look photoshopped in real life. Both colorways come with a bonus pack of three Velcro patches—lightning bolt, flame, sad-face—so you can swap moods faster than you switch group chats.  \n\nTech meets ethics: the liner is knit from algae bloom harvested out of lakes that were too toxic for wildlife, so every pair literally sucks pollution out of the planet. *Rocking the Neon Pulse X means you’re flexing eco karma alongside your fit—capable of sparking a “wait, those are sustainable??” convo that boosts your clout while you school your friends on ocean science.*  \n\nLacing is magnetic: just slide your foot in and the MagLock straps auto-align, no bunny-ear tutorials necessary. Hidden NFC tag in the tongue opens an AR filter that overlays pixel fire on your steps when you record reels; scan once, own it forever.  \n\nSizes run 4–13 youth, half sizes included, because nobody has time for thick-sock hacks. MSRP $129, but if you pre-order through the app you unlock a 48-hour drop code that slices 20 % off and throws in free glow laces.  \n\nBottom line: if your old shoes feel like dial-up in a 5G world, it’s time to upgrade to the Neon Pulse X—engineered for teenage chaos, optimized for viral fame, and recycled for the planet you’ll inherit.

Harry sighed, “Well, at least the room looks festive.” Max responded by dragging the curtains down to join the party, ensuring the window now had the privacy of an open fishbowl.\n\nSECTION 2  \nOne Saturday, Harry attempted to impress his date, Chloe, by showcasing his “well-trained” dog. He planned a picnic in the park: artisanal sandwiches, sparkling lemonade, and a Bluetooth speaker playing smooth jazz. The moment they laid out the blanket, Max spotted a squirrel and initiated Operation Chaos. In one graceful arc, the squirrel sprinted, Max followed, and the leash—still wrapped around Harry’s wrist—yanked him face-first into the potato salad. Chloe watched Harry slide across the blanket like a greased seal, then turned to see Max returning proudly carrying, not the squirrel, but a traffic cone. Harry sat up, salad dripping from his eyebrows, and deadpanned, “I usually juggle next, but I left my flaming torches at home.” Chloe laughed so hard she snorted sparkling lemonade out her nose and declared it the best first date ever.\n\nSECTION 3  \nThat night, Harry attempted to salvage his dignity by giving Max a bath. Max, who believed water was a government conspiracy, responded by treating the tub like a Slip-N-Slide. Soap suds exploded everywhere; Harry slipped, grabbing the shower curtain for support, only to bring the entire rod crashing down like a gladiator’s trident. Covered head-to-toe in bubbles, Harry looked at his equally foamy dog and announced, “From now on, we’re both getting professional grooming; I can’t afford to lose any more security deposits… or dignity.” Max answered with a full-body shake, flinging suds into Harry’s open mouth. Harry gargled, “Delicious, minty fresh betrayal,” then laughed until his abs hurt more than the bruises from the picnic. And somewhere between the shampoo explosions and curtain-rod carnage, Harry realized his “low-maintenance bachelor” days were gone—but his high-comedy life with Max had just begun.", "cost": 0.0010895, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "SECTION", "num_sections": 3}], "result": true}

Include a title in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<REM SLEEP FIST>>\n\nLogline  \nIn a city where people’s nightmares bleed into reality, a washed-up boxer with the illegal ability to punch through dreams must fight his way up the dream-crime underworld before the waking world collapses under the weight of a godlike lucid sleeper.\n\nPlot  \n1. Down but Not Out  \n   – Kyro “Lefty” Ramirez, once the youngest welterweight champ, now slumps as a Vegas casino bouncer.  \n   – Kyro secretly hosts a superpower: when he touches a sleeping person, he can “dive” into that dream and physically affect it—furniture, monsters … and dreamers. Outside, his body is helpless, so dives are strictly black-market. Crooks pay him to force witnesses to forget evidence by yanking memories out of their REM state.  \n\n2. The Job That Shouldn’t Be  \n   – Crime mogul Lucia Voss contracts Kyro for a high-paying dive into her own brother, Milo. Milo is in a month-long coma, trapped in a lucid loop that grows every night, warping Vegas streets once he wakes for seconds at a time: cars melt, statues punch tourists, gravity flips. Lucia wants Milo “reset” before the FBI realizes the chaos leaks from his skull.  \n\n3. Into the Infinite Round  \n   – Kyro dives. Milo’s dream is an ever-shifting megacity skyscraper where each floor is a different genre—kung-fu alley, gladiator arena, zero-G disco. Milo rules it all like a smirking ring announcer.  \n   – Kyro’s fists work here, but Milo can re-write physics: every punch Kyro lands spawns a cruder copy of himself that attacks him. Odds look grim.  \n\n4. Sparring With the Subconscious  \n   – Kyro meets “Eden,” Milo’s projected guardian, a woman made from folded paper cranes who claims she’s also a real-world coma patient elsewhere. She teaches Kyro a banned technique: “oneiric grounding.” By reciting his most painful memory (the death of his sister in the audience during his title fight), Kyro can anchor physics for six minutes, nullifying Milo’s re-writes.  \n\n5. The Waking Starts to Crack  \n   – While Kyro battles inside, Milo’s body convulses in the hospital; chunks of the dream arena rain onto Vegas Blvd as concrete. Feds cordon the city; citizens loot, thinking it’s the end.  \n   – Lucia decides to yank Kyro out before he wins, planning to sell evacuation seats to billionaires. She disconnects Kyro’s body from the dream rig.  \n\n6. Midnight Championship  \n   – Kyro, half-awake, realizes he’s being unplugged. In desperation, he performs “lucid knockout,” a taboo move: punches himself inside the dream, splitting his consciousness. Dream-Kyro keeps fighting Milo; Real-Kyro staggers through hospital halls to reclaim his rig before the 6-minute anchor window ends.  \n   – In the dream, the skyscraper folds into one giant boxing ring floating above a storm. Milo grows to titan size, wearing championship belts as armor. Kyro, fists bloodied, recalls Eden’s hint: Milo’s power feeds on attention. The crowd (dream spectators) chanting “Fight!” fuels him. Kyro must lose the crowd to win.  \n\n7. Fixed Fight, Broken God  \n   – Kyro drops his guard, letting Milo pummel him. He speaks the fighters’ oath of humility, broadcast to every sleeper in Vegas via the coma/psychic feedback. Millions witness an honest boxer refusing to grandstand. The crowd falls silent; Milo shrinks. Kyro lands a single, perfect left cross—Milo’s armor shatters into origami cranes (Eden’s form), which swirl and cocoon the unconscious god-boy.  \n\n8. Dawn and Debt  \n   – Milo wakes up weeping, powers gone, butcoma cured; Vegas stabilizes.  \n   – Kyro exits, face swollen, broke again. Lucia furiously sends thugs, but dream-drunk citizens—now believers in the boxer who saved their dreams—form a protective ring around him.  \n   – Eden’s real body, in a long-term ward across town, opens her eyes for the first time in years; a crane of hospital wristband paper flutters to Kyro’s mailbox with a single word: “Thanks.”  \n\n9. Tagline  \n   – Kyro reopens a run-down gym offering free lessons: “Train the body so the nightmares think twice.” Posters read, “Fear hits back—so hit first.” Roll credits over a montage of kids punching speedbags that, for a flicker, ripple like waterbed dreamscapes.\n\nTone & Visuals  \nNeon-noir meets hyper-saturated dreamscape; fight choreography alternates between brutal grounded boxing and physics-defying wirework. Every KO ripples into the waking skyline—flickering signs, bending streetlights—reminding viewers the border between dreams and daylight is thin, and sometimes a fist can stitch it back together.", "cost": 0.0022065, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Negative, and the world moves forward—catalysts cheering, electrons marching in redcoats of charge. It is positive when caution flags the beaker, when reactions stall like legislation in committee, waiting for a titration of courage or a subsidy of heat. That delta G—small symbol, monumental consequence—writes the invisible budget between what merely burns and what sustainably powers the lights of a nation.\n\nBut let us be clear: even a favorable slope demands activation energy, that first handshake of molecules, the startup cost of change. We must invest—be it in the annealing furnace, the biochemistry of vaccines, or the moral activation required to confront a warming planet. I say to every young scientist, every engineer, every restless experimenter in garage or classroom: pay that cost with the same conviction a democracy pays for freedom, and the reaction will proceed; the products of prosperity will crystallize.\n\nSo tonight, under the fluorescent banners of knowledge, we recommit ourselves to the stewardship of Gibbs’ mandate. We will balance our equations, account for every joule, and ensure that our ambitions remain spontaneous yet responsible. For the republic of science demands no less—its constitution written in conservation laws, its amendments etched on calorimeter walls. Together, with negative delta G as our North Star, we will forge a more perfect union of matter and energy, where no good reaction is left behind.

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "response": "# 11 Captivating Dutch Language Facts That Will Make You *Flabbergasted*\n\nSpoken by roughly 24 million native speakers on two continents, Dutch is often pigeon-holed as “just German with a throat infection.”  \nIn reality, the language is a treasure chest of quirky history, global influence and delightful wordplay.  \nBelow are eleven bite-size facts that show why Dutch deserves more *glorious attention*.\n\n1. **Dutch is not Deutsch.**  \n   Confusing the Netherlands with Germany is an old pastime, but “Dutch” derives from the Old High German *diutisc*, meaning “of the people.”  \n   Over centuries, English narrowed the label to the folks west of the Rhine, while German kept its linguistic cousin, *Deutsch*.\n\n2. **You already speak some Dutch.**  \n   Cookie, yacht, skipper, easel, boss, wagon, *cookie-cutter* and even *Santa Claus* sailed straight out of Dutch into English.  \n   New York City’s Brooklyn? It was once *Breukelen*; Harlem was *Haarlem*; Broadway was *Brede weg* (literally “broad road”).\n\n3. **The world’s longest Dutch word is 49 letters.**  \n   *Kindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedenplan* (children’s carnival parade preparation activities plan) was crowned the longest dictionary entry in 1996.  \n   Try to say that three times fast—or even once!\n\n4. **One big word can say it all.**  \n   Dutch loves compound nouns. Pick almost any random nouns, glue them together, and you’re grammatically golden:  \n   *Hottentottententententoonstelling* (“Hottentot tents exhibition”) is the classic jaw-breaker linguists cite to terrify beginners.\n\n5. **G is for gargle.**  \n   The voiced *g* and *ch* sounds are produced in the same place you clear your throat.  \n   Children learn to say *gracht* (canal) long before they can ride a bike—proof that linguistic gymnastics start early in the Low Countries.\n\n6. **Dutch has gender trouble—on purpose.**  \n   Grammatical gender collapsed from three classes into two (common and neuter), but every native speaker still calls a girl *meisje* with a neuter article: *het* meisje.  \n   *That mismatch* is an adorable historical fossil wandering through modern sentences.\n\n7. **The oldest preserved Dutch sentence is a love charm.**  \n   Dating from 1100 CE, it was scribbled on parchment: *Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu*.  \n   Translation: “All birds have begun their nests, except me and you—what are you waiting for?”  \n   Nine centuries later, Dutch flirting hasn’t changed much.\n\n8. **Africaans is Dutch’s rebellious offspring.**  \n   Settlers took 17th-century Dutch to the Cape of Good Hope; isolation, substrate languages and simplification forged Afrikaans.  \n   The result? A daughter language so close that *Muur* (“wall”) in Dutch becomes *Muur* in Afrikaans, yet grammar melted away like snow in the Karoo sun.\n\n9. **A dialect continuum from Amsterdam to Vienna.**  \n   Hop on a bike and cycle east: you’ll phase smoothly through Low Saxon, Westphalian, Central German and Bavarian without ever hitting a hard linguistic border.  \n   *Verstaanbaarheid* (mutual intelligibility) only breaks down once passports—and *politics*—step in.\n\n10. **English-Dutch false friends are *hilariously cruel*.**  \n    When a Dutch host offers you *roeping* (calling), you’re not being summoned—you’re being offered *smoked eel*.  \n    Ask for *behang* at the DIY store and you’ll get wallpaper, not a headache remedy.\n\n11. **Dutch is Europe’s *stealth* business tongue.**  \n    The Netherlands ranks among the globe’s top exporters despite being smaller than most US states.  \n    Mastering Dutch might not be mandatory, but it unlocks the world’s biggest port (Rotterdam), *multatuli* of maritime law texts and a start-up ecosystem where 90% of locals speak English—yet still do lunch deals in *Nederlands*.\n\nReady for more? Pick up a *fiets* (bike), download a free app like Duolingo Dutch, and let the throat-clearing adventure begin.  \nWho knows—one day you might casually drop *eigenlijk wel*, and every Nederlander within earshot will instantly upgrade you from tourist to *pseudo-Dutchie*.", "cost": 0.002049, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 2}], "result": true}

Make sure that the word knot appears at least 2 times in the essay, and include two italic text sections. Like: *this is italic text*", "response": "The Knot That Binds Us to Wilderness  \n\nWhen the first European surveyors stepped into the North American backcountry, they carried in their rucksacks more than chains and compasses; they carried the assumption that land is a commodity to be sliced into saleable squares. What they could not measure was the invisible knot of relationship—root to mycelium, lynx to snowshoe hare, human heart to horizon—that had been tightening for millennia. Wilderness is not merely a place where roads disappear; it is the strand that still ties our conscience to a world larger than quarterly earnings. Preserving it is therefore not an act of charity toward bears and beetles, but an act of *self-rescue* from the amnesia of modernity.\n\nEvery acre we spare from the engine of extraction is a knot retied. Consider the story of the Great Swamp in New Jersey, a mosaic of red maple and cedar so close to Manhattan that on quiet winter nights the city’s glow stains the clouds. In 1959 the Port Authority proposed an jetport that would have paved 11,000 acres, but a handful of residents—birdwatchers, hunters, garden-club matriarchs—formed the “Great Swamp Committee.” They lobbied, fundraised, and physically carried survey markers out of the muck. Their victory was not simply legal; it was emotional. They reminded a region choking on its own exhaust that *wildness could still be a neighbor, not a memory*. Today, every migrating woodcock that drops into that marsh carries their stubbornness in its wings, a living knot of refusal against entropy.\n\nYet the phrase “wilderness preservation” can mislead us into thinking the task is finished once boundaries are drawn on a map. The truth is that wild country is less a static sanctuary than a slow-motion conversation between geology and biology, a conversation we are invited to overhear but not to moderate. When we designate a wilderness area we are tying a knot in time, saying: “Let this corner of the planet continue to write its own sentences without our red pen.” The knot is inherently provisional; climate change, invasive species, and even our own footprints keep tugging at the cord. What looks like permanence today may tomorrow look like a frayed promise.\n\nThat fragility is why wilderness advocacy must evolve from scenic postcards to ecological literacy. A hiker who sees a stand of beetle-killed spruce as ugliness misunderstands the forest’s grammar; those gray trunks are the university for the next cohort of woodpeckers and fire-dependent wildflowers. Likewise, we must learn to see the invisible knot between distant wildlands and our kitchen faucets: the Yukon’s peatlands store carbon that keeps Miami above water, just as the Uinta Mountains’ snowpack keeps Phoenix in lettuce. Sever one strand and the whole lattice loosens. *Preservation is not withdrawal from the world but a subtler form of participation*, a promise to keep the conversation going by occasionally remaining silent.\n\nThe moral geometry is simple: every generation inherits both a toolbox and a coil of rope. We can use the tools to dismantle the knot, parceling the last ridges into view-lot subdivisions, or we can retie it, leaving extra slack for unfamiliar species that will need room to migrate in a warming century. Either way, the choice is our signature on the planet’s rough ledger. Wilderness preservation is therefore the longest human love letter ever written, addressed to recipients we will never meet—children who will measure maturity not by how much they possess, but by how much they can allow to remain unowned.\n\nIf you listen at the edge of a designated wilderness at dusk, you may hear the sound of the knot tightening: a wolf’s howl echoing off granite, the slow drip of meltwater into an unnamed creek, the sudden hush when wind decides to hold its breath. Those sounds are reminders that the world is still underway, still inventing itself, and that our best gift is to stand aside often enough for the invention to continue. Let us, then, become connoisseurs of that silence, guardians of the knot, humble enough to preserve what we did not create and wise enough to realize that in doing so we preserve the only earth capable of preserving us.", "cost": 0.0017875, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "knot", "frequency": 2}, {"num_highlights": 2}], "result": true}

He was born in 1140 to Raymond II of Tripoli and Hodierna of Jerusalem. His father was murdered when Raymond was twelve years old so he became Count under the regency of his mother. Raymond was sent to the court of Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos for his education. He returned to Tripoli in 1157 and assumed full control of the county. His reign was marked by constant involvement in the political struggles of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\n*Early life and regency* describes how Raymond became Count at a young age after his father's assassination. His mother Hodierna ruled as regent until he reached maturity. He spent several years in Constantinople where he received a thorough education and developed a love for Byzantine culture. This experience would later influence his political decisions and diplomatic approach.\n\nRaymond played a major role in the dynastic conflicts of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. He supported the claim of Queen Melisende and her son Baldwin III against their rival Melisende's sister-in-law. After Baldwin III's death Raymond became an important advisor to the young king Amalric. He married Eschiva of Bures which gave him influence in the Principality of Galilee. Their marriage produced several children including his heir Raymond IV.\n\n*Conflict with the Knights Templar* details how Raymond had ongoing disputes with the military order over territories and privileges in Tripoli. The Templars built castles in the county which Raymond saw as threats to his authority. These tensions sometimes escalated into open conflict though they were usually resolved through negotiation. Raymond also had to balance relations with the Byzantine Empire and the growing power of Nur ad-Din Zangi.\n\nDuring the late 1170s Raymond emerged as a key figure in the succession crisis following the death of King Baldwin IV. The king suffered from leprosy and had no clear heir. Raymond was elected as bailli or regent for the kingdom in 1174. He faced challenges from Sibylla the king's sister and her husband Guy of Lusignan. *Regency and succession crisis* explains how Raymond tried to maintain stability while dealing with factional disputes. He attempted to arrange a marriage between Sibylla and a suitable candidate who could unite the kingdom. However his efforts were undermined by political intrigue and foreign intervention.\n\nRaymond died in 1187 shortly before the Battle of Hattin. His death marked the end of an era for Tripoli as the county faced increasing pressure from Muslim forces. He left behind a complex legacy as both a capable administrator and a controversial political figure. His descendants continued to rule Tripoli until the county was conquered by the Mamluks in 1289.", "cost": 0.0011825, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma", "detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_highlights": 3}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 300}], "result": true}

{"id": 1072, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post with 400 or more words about the benefits of sleeping in a hammock.", "response": "Sleep Like a Leaf: Seven Unexpected Benefits of Trading Your Bed for a Hammock\n\nMost people think of hammocks as backyard toys or backpacker luxuries—nice for a Sunday nap, not for real life. Yet a quiet revolution is happening in bedrooms from Bogotá to Brooklyn: people are unhooking their box springs, drilling two eye-bolts into the wall, and sleeping every night in a piece of nautical fabric that sways like a boat. They aren’t doing it for the Instagram aesthetic; they’re doing it because their backs stopped hurting, their allergies vanished, and—most importantly—they finally wake up feeling alive. Below are seven science-backed reasons you might want to join them.\n\n1. A Spinal Tune-Up Every Night  \nChiropractors like Dr. José de la Cruz in San José, Costa Rica, have started prescribing hammocks instead of orthopedic mattresses. Why? A well-hung hammock eliminates pressure points. When you lie diagonally—the “Brazilian lie”—the fabric molds to the natural S-curve of your spine instead of forcing it flat. A 2019 study at the University of Freiburg found that subjects with chronic lumbar pain reported a 31 % reduction in stiffness after four weeks of hammock sleeping versus only 9 % in the control group on memory foam. No expensive coils, no 90-day trial periods—just gravity and cloth.\n\n2. Anti-Aging, One Rock at a Time  \nThe rocking motion that mothers use to quiet babies also works on adults. Swiss neuroscientists rocking beds back and forth every four seconds discovered that the vestibular system triggers bursts of “sleep spindles,” brain waves that deepen non-REM sleep. Deeper sleep means more growth hormone, less cortisol, and—over time—fewer wrinkles and stronger immunity. Participants fell asleep a full six minutes faster in the rocking condition and slept through more audio beeps the next morning.\n\n3. Temperature Regulation Without the Thermostat  \nA mattress is a heat sink; memory foam is notorious for “sleeping hot.” A hammock, by contrast, is suspended air. Heat dissipates above and below you, keeping core body temperature in the narrow 0.5 °C drop that triggers melatonin release. In tropical latitudes this means you can skip the air-conditioning, saving an average of 350 kWh per summer month—enough to offset the carbon cost of shipping your hammock fabric from recycled sailcloth in Maine.\n\n4. The Dust-Mite Death Zone  \nThe average ten-year-old mattress doubles in weight from sweat, skin flakes, and micro-arthropod feces. A hammock is machine-washable; five minutes on cold cycle and you’ve nuked the allergen colony. Asthmatics in a 2022 Lisbon pulmonary clinic reported 42 % less nighttime inhaler use after switching, simply because there was nowhere for mites to hide.\n\n5. Space-Time Magic  \nA Brazilian double hammock rolled up is smaller than a loaf of bread. In studios where rent is measured by the square inch, removing the bed frees up 28 square feet—enough for a yoga mat or a desk. One couple in Seattle even fits a fold-away crib beneath the hanging; the swaying lulls both newborn and parents.\n\n6. Micro-Core Workout  \nYou don’t get “abs in a hammock,” but you do engage stabilizer muscles every time you turn over. Physiotherapists love this for post-surgery patients who need gentle activation without impact. Over six months, habitual hammock sleepers in a small Swedish trial improved single-leg balance by 23 %—a stealth benefit your standing desk will never deliver.\n\n7. Psychological Weightlessness  \nThere’s a primal reason we pay extra for oceanfront rooms: the vestige of the womb. Gentle rocking lowers sympathetic-nervous-system firing, the fight-or-flight loop that keeps you scrolling at 1 a.m. EEG readings show a 12 % increase in theta waves—the same frequency cultivated by experienced meditators—simply by letting the fabric sway two centimeters. You fall asleep faster because your brain thinks it’s still floating.\n\nMaking the Switch—Without Ending Up on the Floor  \nStart with a 10-foot-wide “parachute nylon” hammock, 150 denier for breathability. Hang it with 30-degree sag so the center sits 18 inches off the ground; too tight and it becomes a cocoon, too low and you’ll bottom out. Lie diagonally so your head and feet stay open—no banana curve. Use a small pillow under the knees if you’re a back sleeper; side sleepers can tuck another pillow between the fabric and ribs. In winter, add a quilt and an under-blanket rather than compressing a sleeping bag underneath you.\n\nOne month in, you’ll wake up the way kids do on summer camp mornings—reflexively happy, oddly graceful, and surprised by how quiet the city sounds when your body isn’t busy being angry at the bed it just fought all night.", "cost": 0.002078, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 400}], "result": true}

Make sure to use the word war at least 8 times, and the word peace at least 10 times.", "response": "The Tang dynasty (618–907 CE) is often remembered as a golden age for China, but its story is one of shifting tides between war and peace.\n\nThe dynasty began after years of civil war during the fall of the Sui dynasty. Li Yuan, the first Tang emperor, seized power through war and then worked to establish peace across the fractured land. Early Tang rulers expanded the empire through war, pushing into Central Asia and Korea, but they also secured peace within China’s borders by rebuilding infrastructure and restoring centralized governance.\n\nUnder Emperor Taizong, the Tang experienced a balance of war and peace. He led successful military campaigns that extended Tang influence, but he was also known for promoting peace through wise administration and Confucian ideals. Trade flourished, and the Silk Road thrived in relative peace, though war loomed on the frontiers.\n\nThe reign of Empress Wu Zetian saw fewer wars of expansion but more internal consolidation. She maintained peace in the bureaucracy and promoted talent over noble birth. Though criticized by later historians, her era contributed to a long stretch of peace that helped stabilize the empire.\n\nThe peak of Tang power came under Emperor Xuanzong, early in his reign marked by cultural brilliance and peace. Arts, poetry, and Buddhism spread in a climate of peace. Yet this peace was deceptive. Later in his rule, neglect of military affairs and favoritism led to the devastating An Lushan Rebellion—a civil war that nearly tore the dynasty apart. This war lasted nearly eight years, claimed millions of lives, and shattered the peace forever.\n\nAfter the war, the Tang never fully regained its former strength. Regional warlords rose, and centralized power weakened. Border wars increased, especially with the Tibetan Empire and the Uighur Khaganate, while internal peace became harder to maintain. The dynasty limped on for another century and a half, but the golden age of peace had ended.\n\nEventually, more war followed—peasant rebellions, regional warlordism, and court intrigue. In 907 CE, the Tang dynasty fell, not with a final war but with a whimper, as a military governor declared himself emperor. The long era of Tang peace was remembered fondly, but it had been repeatedly broken by war, rebellion, and unrest.\n\nIn the end, the Tang dynasty showed how even the most powerful empires must constantly balance war and peace, and how peace, once lost, is hard to reclaim.", "cost": 0.0010279999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "war", "frequency": 8}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "peace", "frequency": 10}], "result": true}

Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", "response": "\"By the 1890s, the Habsburg Monarchy was no longer the bright promise it had seemed to many South-Slav intellectuals in the 1830s-1860s.  Both Croatians and Serbians who lived under the Crown of St Stephen (Croatia-Slavonia, the Military Frontier, Dalmatia, and the Voivodina) had accumulated grievances, yet the texture of those grievances differed, and so did the emotional vocabulary in which they were expressed.  The following pages try to separate resentment from loyalty, fear from contempt, and, above all, Croat from Serb modes of feeling, while bearing in mind that neither “Croatian” nor “Serbian” opinion was monolithic: courtly bishops, Zagreb students, Sarajevo Franciscans, Belgrade diplomats, voivodina peasants, and Dubrovnik merchants did not automatically share a single emotional register.\n\n1.  Croatian attitudes: from “_triune kingdom_” to “_trialist nightmare_”  \n   a.  Constitutional bitterness  \n   In 1868 the Croat-Hungarian Settlement (Nagodba) had promised Croats autonomy inside the Hungarian half of the Dual Monarchy.  By the 1890s every new county ordinance, linguistic decree, or railway tariff that Budapest imposed was felt in Zagreb as a fresh betrayal.  The Nagodba had left finance, transport, and higher education in Magyar hands; Magyarisation of the railways and post office meant that even Croatian ticket clerks had to master Hungarian.  Croat politicians therefore spoke of the Empire less as a benevolent “House” than as a condominium in which the Magyar half systematically humiliated them while Vienna looked on.  Sentiment: wounded constitutional pride shaded into cynicism.  \n   b.  The Yugoslav idea as emotional compensation  \n   Because the Empire no longer delivered status, many Croatian intellectuals filled the emotional void with “Yugoslavism.”  Strossmayer’s Yugoslav Academy, the Zagreb Philharmonic’s tours to Belgrade, the 1894 Croat-Serb student co-operative “Zvonimir” in Prague, and the newspaper *Smotra Dalmatinska* all cultivated the feeling that Vienna might be dispensable if South Slavs federated among themselves.  Yugoslavism was not (yet) separatism; it was a sentimental bench on which Croats could sit while waiting for Vienna to notice them.  When that wait seemed endless, Yugoslavism became anti-Austrian by default.  \n   c.  Dynastic loyalty in public, mockery in private  \n   The Croatian Sabor still toasted the Emperor-King’s birthday with trumpets and *Zivio!*  But in the coffee-houses of Ilica street, the same deputies referred to Franz Joseph as “the old gentleman in Schönbrunn who signs whatever Budapest puts under his nose.”  Franz Ferdinand’s 1898 visit to Zagreb—cancelled at the last minute for security reasons—was greeted by satirical verses in *Kvatric* that portrayed the Archduke as a giant red-legged heron too scared to land among croaking “Slav frogs.”  Thus public ceremonial loyalty coexisted with private ridicule.  \n   d.  Peasant indifference, gentry schizophrenia  \n   In the villages of Slavonia and the Littoral the Empire meant conscription, tobacco tax, and the district captain who certified pigs for export.  Peasants therefore felt the State as a bureaucratic irritant rather than a national oppressor; their emotional temperature was low.  The small land-owning gentry, by contrast, owed patents of nobility to Vienna and mortgages to Budapest banks.  Their hearts were Habsburg, their heads increasingly Magyar-phobe, producing a durable split consciousness that Croatian politics would export into the twentieth century.\n\n2.  Serbian attitudes: from “ _Vienna protectorate fantasy_” to “_pan-Serb impatience_”  \n   a.  The empire as obstacle to unification  \n   Serbs inside Croatia-Slavonia and, above all, in the Voivodina and Bosnia, measured Vienna against the yard-stick of Belgrade.  Every customs post along the Sava announced that the Monarchy kept two million Serbs outside the jurisdiction of “their” kingdom.  Thus the Empire felt to them less like an oppressive landlord (as it did to Croats) than like a locked gate on the road to national integration.  Sentiment: impatient resentment fueled by kin-state nationalism.  \n   b.  Bosnia 1878-1903: gratitude curdling into contempt  \n   Orthodox Bosnian peasants initially welcomed Austro-Hungarian troops as liberators from Ottoman tax farmers.  Within a decade, however, the provincial regime’s confessional school laws, the import of Czech bureaucrats, and above all the land reform that benefited Muslim beys but not Orthodox share-croppers bred disillusionment.  Serb newspapers in Sarajevo (e.g., *Bosanska Vila*) began to print anecdotes in which Baron Benjamin Kállay, the joint-finance minister, figured as a new Pasha.  The emotional shift was from relief at Ottoman eclipse to anger at Habsburg paternalism.  \n   c.  Voivodina: economic boom under Magyar assault  \n   The fertile plain around Novi Sad experienced the highest wheat yields per hectare in Europe and, thanks to Budapest’s railway grid, direct export to Liverpool and Rotterdam.  Serbian merchants therefore accumulated capital under the Empire’s umbrella.  Yet the same Budapest that financed their silos also abolished the Serbian church-school council (1890) and imposed Magyar as the language of rail freight.  The result was a characteristic South-Slav alloy: wallet loyalty to the Monarchy, throat loyalty to Serbian cultural nationalism.  Songs at the Svetozar Miletić monument combined the Austrian anthem with the Serbian *Bože pravde* in a single evening; no one sensed a contradiction.  \n   d.  Secret society romanticism  \n   In Belgrade itself, the educated public read Vienna dispatches that portrayed Serbia as a Balkan nuisance.  Intellectuals reacted by glorifying every anti-Habsburg gesture: the 1883 Timok rebellion, the 1886 Sarajevo student walk-out, and the 1899 Kičevo monastery petition.  Such events were magnified inside the Serbian press into morality tales of “enslaved brothers.”  The emotional payoff was cathartic: reading about distant cousins who snubbed the Emperor allowed Belgrade stockbrokers to feel participants in a nation-wide uprising.\n\n3.  Shared emotional lexicons across the Sava and Danube  \n   a.  Conscription as crucible  \n   Every male Croatian or Serbian peasant who returned from a three-year stint in Graz or Pécs had acquired conversational German, medical care, and an imperial pension booklet.  The Monarchy therefore entered village memory as a provider of concrete benefits even while it remained the distant target of nationalist curses.  Veterans laughed at German drill but still hung portraits of Franz Joseph above the oak chest.  Sentiment: a practical gratitude that neither endorsed nor contradicted political loyalty.  \n   b.  Religious emotionalism  \n   For Croats, Catholic baroque pomp—plumed bishops, Corpus Christi parades—was inseparable from Habsburg legitimacy; to reject Vienna would be to cast doubt on ritual identity.  For Serbs, the Orthodox clergy preached that the Emperor, though schismatic, was at least a Christian sovereign preferable to the Turk; yet the same priests blessed clandestine reading rooms where *The Mountain Wreath* was recited as a call to unification with “free Serbia.”  Thus confessional culture mediated, but never fully determined, political feeling in both nations.  \n   c.  The language of mockery  \n   By 1900 Croatian satirist Antun Gustav Matoš and Serbian humourist Radoje Domanović both used the same comic tropes: pompous German-speaking district captains, Magyar gentry who spoke broken Croatian, and Czech bureaucrats who tried to placate angry Serbian commune heads with Viennese pastries.  Shared laughter at Habsburg provincialism allowed Croat and Serb students in Vienna and Prague to sense a common South-Slav ridicule that transcended their mutual rivalry.\n\n4.  Fault-lines inside each nation  \n   a.  Croatian fracture: Starčevićists vs. Mažuranićists  \n   The heirs of Ante Starčević labeled the Empire an “Asian prison” and flirted with boycott; the liberal followers of Ivan Mažuranić argued that Croatian state right could still be vindicated inside the Monarchy.  Street graffiti in Zagreb illustrated the clash: the inscription “Zapad ili Smrt!” (West or Death!) appeared one night, only to be painted over next day by students who wrote “Naš je dom u Habsburgu!” (Our home is in the Habsburg realm!).  Sentiment oscillated between exit and voice.  \n   b.  Serbian fracture: Realpolitik merchants vs. romantic nationalists  \n   Wealthy grain exporters in Novi Sad financed the Serbian National Theater and the Matica srpska library, both of which needed Budapest subsidies.  For them, Habsburg citizenship was a practical asset.  Young officers in Belgrade, by contrast, collected subscriptions for Bosnian guerrillas and quoted Garibaldi.  Thus two Serbian emotional economies—bourgeois pragmatism and heroic romanticism—coexisted, linked by family networks but pulling in opposite directions.\n\n5.  Toward the fin-de-siècle acceleration  \n   a.  The 1897 Badeni crisis  \n   When the Vienna government tried to make Czech-German bilingualism compulsory for the whole Empire, Croatian papers sarcastically asked whether Croatian would be next; Serbian commentators replied that the Monarchy was too decrepit to learn new tricks.  The episode revealed that both peoples had moved from petition to derision as their default register.  \n   b.  The 1899 Ban Khuen-Héderváry’s electoral coup  \n   Count Khuen’s open manipulation of the Croatian Sabor convinced even unionist politicians that Vienna would always prefer Magyar stability to Croat legality.  Sentiment hardened into a conviction that loyalty was useless because the dice were loaded.  In Belgrade, the news was read as proof that “Austria” (the generic Slavic term for the entire Monarchy) would never concede South-Slav equality.  Thus a Croatian administrative grievance fed Serbian geopolitical pessimism.  \n   c.  Cultural mirror: the 1900 Paris Expo  \n   Croatia sent a pavilion full of folkloric embroidery; Serbia, having secured independent status in 1878, displayed its army regalia.  Vienna newspapers praised Croatian charm but mocked the Serbian eagle as “pretentious.”  The slight travelled back to Zagreb and Belgrade as further evidence of imperial condescension.\n\n6.  Measuring the emotional thermometer  \n   By 1903, when the century turned, the dominant sentiments can be summarised as:  \n   – Croats: constitutional disappointment, Yugoslav romanticism, ceremonial loyalty, private mockery;  \n   – Serbs: gate-keeping resentment, Bosnia-specific contempt, Voivodina pragmatism, Belgrade heroic romanticism;  \n   – Both: conscript gratitude, confessional ambiguity, satiric solidarity, accelerating pessimism about reformability.\n\nThe Austrian Empire had become, in South-Slav eyes, neither a benevolent patriarch nor an outright ogre, but a once-promising house whose beams were cracking.  Most Croatians still hoped the cracks could be mended from within; most Serbs, observing the same fissures, concluded the house should be dismantled so that scattered kin could build a new one together.  The emotions of 1903—half-loyal irony on one bank of the Sava, half-hostile impatience on the other—were still reversible, yet they already carried the psychological seed-corn of 1914.\"", "cost": 0.005143, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 800}], "result": true}

Give me advice in the style of a President of the United States and make sure it has at least 600 words.", "response": "My fellow American,\n\nYou hold in your hand more than a ten-cent piece of cupronickel. You cradle the thinnest wafer of possibility, the metallic echo of Franklin Roosevelt’s fireside chats, the glint that once bought a Depression-era loaf of bread and, in so doing, bought time for a nation gasping for hope. Do not let its size fool you; great democracies have turned on smaller pivots.\n\nFirst, remember: this dime is yours because a free people decided that no king, no commissar, no corner-office tycoon would decide your worth. The same Treasury seal that minted this coin minted the covenant that you—yes, you—are endowed with the right to pursue happiness in ten-cent increments if need be. Hold it up to the light. See the torch? That is not mere decoration; it is the same torch that Ellis Island lifted to the tired, the poor, the huddled masses. Let it remind you that opportunity is not the privilege of the few but the inheritance of the many, pressed and re-pressed like unto this slender planchet.\n\nNow, what shall we do with this inheritance? Let me propose, as one who has walked the solemn halls of power and felt the loneliest weight of nuclear codes, that the smallest actions can radiate outward like ripples in an August pond at Camp David.\n\n1. Invest it, not in the Wall Street of movie villains, but in the Wall Street of your nephew’s lemonade stand. Drop that dime into his mason-jar cash register tomorrow morning. Tell him it is seed capital, a micro-loan from the Bank of Uncle Sam himself. Watch his eyes widen as he realizes that capital can begin with capital-C courage, not capital-M millions. Years from now, when he incorporates his first company—maybe a solar-shingle startup, maybe a theatre troupe—he will remember that the first investor believed in him for the price of a phone call. That is how we compound national optimism.\n\n2. Feed the meter—yes, the one by the veterans’ memorial downtown. Buy a stranger forty-five minutes of parking. Inside that car might be a Marine who stood watch at Kabul gate, now interviewing for a job that could keep her family housed. Your dime buys time; time buys dignity; dignity buys a republic that keeps its promises to those who kept us safe. When you walk away, salute the bumper sticker that reads “Freedom Isn’t Free,” and know you just paid a tiny dividend.\n\n3. Slip it into the red kettle that rings outside the supermarket where inflation, like winter, nips at every sleeve. The Salvation Army captain will never know your name, but the widow who receives a hot turkey because the kettle met its nightly goal will taste anonymity flavored with love. In the ledger of democracy, that is a balanced budget.\n\n4. Teach with it. Visit a fifth-grade classroom and ask for a show of hands: “Who here has held a Roosevelt dime?” Half will not have seen one, so tribal is their venmoverse. Place it on the projector under a document camera. Tell them how FDR, stricken with polio, nevertheless piloted the arsenal of democracy from a wheelchair. Then challenge each student to bring tomorrow a story of someone who did enormous good from a position of apparent weakness. You will have spent ten cents and sown a curriculum of empathy.\n\n5. Leave it as a tip, alongside mightier bills, to the diner waitress who calls you “hon” because courtesy is her native tongue. Roosevelt once declared, “I see one-third of a nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished.” Precisely because that fraction stubbornly persists, slip your dime face-up beneath the coffee cup, so that when she clears the table, the torch stares back at her like a tiny promise that her labor is seen. Micromedicine for macro discouragement.\n\n6. Create art. Pound it flat under a railroad track, engrave initials, thread it on a leather cord, and mail it to your state legislator with a note: “Here is my contribution to cleaner-energy legislation. I know it is only ten cents, but if you multiply it by every child who will breathe the air you vote to protect, the alloy becomes priceless.” Civic ornament can shame civic torpor.\n\n7. Preserve history. Drop it into the museum donation box at the little courthouse where Susan B. Anthony was once fined for daring to cast a ballot. Let the docent know that your dime stands in honor of the 19th Amendment and against any modern poll tax, literal or labyrinthine. Ten cents toward the perpetuation of memory is cheaper than the cost of forgetting.\n\n8. Flip it. Not in the cynical sense of “flip-flop,” but in the playful sense of childhood arbitration: heads we volunteer at the food bank this Saturday, tails we write postcards to lonely seniors. Either outcome enriches the commonwealth, and the metallic arc through sunlight becomes a fleeting Liberty Bell in miniature, ringing not in Philadelphia but in your palm.\n\n9. Melt it—metaphorically. Pledge never to let this dime reside idle in a ceramic jar labeled “rainy day” while actual storms—opioid despair, rising seas,伪造 news—beat against our neighbors’ windows. Money, like manure, does the most good when spread. Circulate it; let traction and friction earn their moral interest.\n\n10. Finally, pass it on as a lettered artifact of citizenship. Include it in your child’s lunchbox with a sticky note: “Democracy is not a spectator sport. Today at recess, invite someone sitting alone to join four-square. This dime is your badge of ambassador duty.” The playground is the first republic we ever know; practice at recess becomes practice at the ballot box.\n\nMy friends, I have held the launch codes and I have held dimes. Believe me when I say the latter, deployed with intentional love, can avert as many catastrophes as the former, if hurled early enough at the poverty of spirit that precedes every war. A dime, orphaned from its purse, is a lonely thing; but a dime accompanied by a story becomes a centurion of possibilities, marching in phalanx with millions of others, until the very clang of change in our pockets sounds like a drumbeat of common purpose.\n\nSo go, citizen. Spend this dime as though the audacity of hope itself were minted on its rim. Spend it as though wheat stalks on the reverse were still rooted in amber waves of grain and not merely nostalgia. Spend it as though the ship of state were a piggy bank we each must feed, not a casino we each must plunder.\n\nAnd when you do, remember the oath I swore on the Capitol steps: to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. That parchment did not survive because men in powdered wigs wrote eloquently; it survived because ordinary people, again and again, placed their tiny, ferocious faith in one another—sometimes no larger than a dime—and in so doing forged a more perfect union, ten cents at a time.\n\nMay God bless you, and may the torch on that ten-cent piece never flicker out, so long as hands like yours are willing to carry the flame.\n\nWith confidence in the currency of conscience,\n\nYour President", "cost": 0.003061, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}], "result": true}

Don’t forget to include the keywords waste, material and meal. Have more than 30 sentences in your response.", "response": "Aluminium cans are one of the most common sights on supermarket shelves, quietly protecting everything from tomato soup to black beans, yet their true importance in food storage is often overlooked by the average shopper.  \nEvery time a consumer lifts a ready-to-eat meal packed in a lightweight cylinder, they are holding a piece of engineering that has revolutionised how we conserve flavour, nutrition and time.  \nThe material itself—aluminium—was once more precious than gold, but today it is mined, refined and rolled into thin sheets at volumes measured in millions of tonnes, all so that a single portion of ravioli can remain edible for years.  \nWhat makes aluminium such an ideal host for food is its uncanny ability to block light, oxygen and moisture, the three horsemen of spoilage that ride through cardboard, plastic and even glass.  \nBecause oxygen cannot penetrate the microscopic lattice of this metal, bacteria that would happily colonise an open bowl of chilli find themselves locked outside the can, unable to begin the biochemical vandalism that turns a meal into waste.  \nLight, another saboteur, is equally rebuffed; the dark interior of an aluminium can prevents photo-oxidation that can turn delicate fats rancid in seconds under supermarket fluorescents.  \nMoisture, the third culprit, meets the same metallic wall, ensuring that a peach swimming in syrup at the factory in Georgia will still taste like summer orchard in a Minneapolis kitchen two winters later.  \nFrom a sheer logistics perspective, the stackability of these cylinders is a marvel; a single pallet can carry 3 750 cans of corn, enough to provide a vegetable serving for every seat in a baseball stadium, while occupying the same footprint as a living-room rug.  \nThis dense packing translates directly into fuel savings, because fewer trucks are needed to move the same number of meals, thereby trimming the carbon shadow that often accompanies food distribution.  \nEqually critical is the speed with which cans can be filled; modern lines purr along at 2 000 containers per minute, shooting precise doses of minestrone into each cup before seaming lids in a blinding 0.3-second clinch that will keep microbes out for half a decade.  \nThe process is not merely mechanical theatre—it is a race against time and temperature, because every second a prepared meal sits unsealed invites microbial gate-crashers that could condemn entire batches to the landfill.  \nQuality-control engineers station laser sensors every few metres to check for micro-fractures in the aluminium, knowing that a hairline breach only a few micrometres wide can widen under the rhythmic jostle of a freight car, letting in air and condemning a family’s dinner to early waste.  \nOnce sealed, the cans enter a spiral cooker where 120 °C steam roams the interior for forty minutes, pasteurising the contents so that even the spores of Clostridium botulinum, the Everest of food pathogens, capitulate.  \nThis retort step would melt plastic or shatter glass, yet aluminium merely flexes, its crystalline structure relaxing microscopically and then re-tightening as it cools, leaving the meal inside commercially sterile without the need for chemical preservatives.  \nConsumers often worry about a metallic taste, but the interior of every food can is sprayed with an epoxy lacquer thinner than a human hair, a transparent shield that prevents any cation migration from the material to the meal.  \nThat lacquer is itself a feat of polymer chemistry, formulated to resist acids such as tomato’s citric punch yet flexible enough to dent without flaking, ensuring that the first spoonful of soup tastes exactly like the recipe developed in the test kitchen.  \nSustainability advocates sometimes criticise aluminium for its energy-intensive birth, yet the same property that makes refining costly—aluminium’s tight atomic bond—makes recycling spectacularly efficient.  \nA recycled can becomes a new can in as little as sixty days, using only five percent of the energy required to extract the metal from bauxite ore, a closed-loop rebirth that is the gold standard of circular-economy dreams.  \nIn countries such as Germany and Brazil, deposit-return schemes push recovery rates past ninety percent, meaning that every aisle of canned peaches is effectively stocked with yesterday’s soda containers rather than with fresh mountains of virgin ore.  \nEven the pull-tab, that tiny finger-sized lever, has been redesigned to stay attached, eliminating the litter of detritus that once turned parks into metallic minefields and ensuring that the entire material stays within the recycling stream.  \nIndustry statisticians like to point out that a single tonne of recycled aluminium saves nine tonnes of CO₂ emissions, the same climate benefit as taking a car off the road for six months; multiply that by the 300 billion cans produced yearly and the arithmetic becomes a planetary exhale.  \nYet the story is not only one of ecological triumph, because the social dimensions of canned food are equally compelling; after hurricanes, earthquakes and conflicts, pallets of aluminium cylinders are among the first relief payloads to arrive.  \nTheir light weight allows soldiers and volunteers to hand-carry them across ruined roads where glass jars would shatter and bulk sacks would soak up monsoon rain, turning relief supplies into useless mush.  \nInside each can is precisely measured nutrition—400 grams of beans delivering 14 grams of protein, the difference between a child’s empty stare and the energy required to attend a makeshift school the next morning.  \nThe psychological comfort should not be discounted; the familiar hiss of a can opener can restore a semblance of domestic normalcy when every other kitchen tool has been buried under rubble, turning emergency rations into an emotional meal.  \nDesigners have even begun printing QR codes on can ends; scanning the shimmering surface with a phone reveals farm origin, harvest date and carbon score, so that a shopper in Tokyo can know that the corn inside was grown in Ontario only three months earlier.  \nThis traceability answers modern anxieties about food fraud, because the aluminium surface acts as a data carrier as well as a barrier, merging physical material with digital metadata in a way glass or paper cannot match.  \nCampers appreciate how quickly a can nestles into a bed of embers, its conductive walls spreading heat so evenly that a chilli con carne can bubble to mouth-watering perfection without scorching, turning a cold mountain night into a five-star meal under constellations.  \nArtists, too, have embraced the leftover cylinder, cutting patterns into the thin wall to create lantern shadows that dance across festival lawns, proving that post-consumer waste can be upcycled into cultural capital rather than mere landfill fodder.  \nEven the sound design of a can is intentional; that crisp pop when the seal breaks is engineered by subtle pressure differentials, giving the brain an audible confirmation that the contents are still vacuum-sealed and safe, a sensory handshake between industry and appetite.  \nYet challenges remain; bisphenol-A, once a common ingredient in protective linings, has fallen under regulatory scrutiny, spurring chemists to develop plant-based resins that can survive the same retort furnace without leaching trace compounds into someone’s minestrone.  \nCorrosion engineers worry about acidic drinks such as energy beverages that dip below pH 3, demanding new alloy blends that include微量 manganese and magnesium to fend off pitting that could perforate the wall before the best-before date.  \nWaste-reduction specialists argue for smaller can sizes in ageing societies where single-person households proliferate, because a 1-litre cylinder of soup can condemn half its contents to the compost bucket if Grandma only needs one bowl.  \nConversely, institutional kitchens serving refugee camps prefer institutional #10 cans, three-litre giants that can feed 25 people from one opening, illustrating how the same material scales from solitary snacking to mass humanitarian meals.  \nLooking forward, smart-packaging startups are embedding RFID antennas directly into the aluminium slug before it is drawn into a can, allowing pallets to self-report temperature abuse during ocean shipping, thereby pre-emptively diverting spoiled loads before they ever reach a warehouse.  \nOthers experiment with powdered vegetables compressed into the lacquer itself, so that when the metal is recycled the embedded nutrients dissolve into agricultural fertiliser, closing yet another loop and turning yesterday’s beer can into tomorrow’s tomato vine.  \nAll these innovations orbit around the same immutable fact: aluminium cans remain the lightest, strongest and most recyclable guardians of our food supply, quietly enabling civilisation to store summer sunshine in the form of peaches so that winter hunger becomes a choice rather than a fate.  \nWhether we are backpackers, relief workers, busy parents or gourmet chefs, each of us depends on this metallic servant to keep waste at bay, nutrition intact and the shared ritual of the meal possible anywhere on Earth, from a candle-lit dining room to a disaster zone lit only by headlamps.", "cost": 0.0036585, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["waste", "material", "meal"]}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 31}], "result": true}

The first would be to estimate how many time you have everyday for parenting, and is that enough....\"\nAvoid using the following keywords: sleep, cook, feed\nMention the keyword 'schedule' for more than 5 times.", "response": "You may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan. The first would be to estimate how many hours you have every day for parenting, and is that enough to cover everything your child needs—school runs, playdates, homework supervision, and the inevitable last-minute dashes to the store for poster board or forgotten sneakers. Most parents discover that until they lay the hours out on paper, the day feels like a magician’s scarf: endless, yet somehow disappearing in a puff.\n\nBegin with a blank weekly grid. Draw seven columns, label them Monday through Sunday, then divide each into thirty-minute blocks from the moment the household wakes until the last storybook closes. Shade in the blocks you already owe to your employer, your commute, and the non-negotiable appointments that keep the roof intact and the refrigerator humming. What remains tells you the raw clay from which you must sculpt a reliable schedule. If the unshaded slivers look alarmingly narrow, do not panic; this is precisely why the helper is in the room.\n\nThe helper—perhaps a mediator, a family coach, or a wise grandparent who has agreed to neutrality—will ask harder questions next. Who packs the lunch kits? Which parent tracks the pediatric dentist’s six-month check-ups? Who knows the exact date the school permission slip must be returned? If both partners shrug, the helper will suggest that every recurring task be anchored to one adult’s schedule. Clarity prevents the invisible labor from sliding through the cracks and landing on the person who “notices first,” a role that usually becomes a resentment magnet.\n\nNext, translate the hidden tasks into clock time. Thirty minutes to locate the shin-guards, fifteen to fill out the reading-log, ten to braid hair before picture day—the minutes accumulate like snowflakes in a drift. Add these micro-duties to the schedule until the grid begins to look realistic rather than aspirational. Parents often discover they need an extra hour per day they did not know they were spending; acknowledging it is the first step toward redistributing it.\n\nNow build the child’s schedule into the master plan. Color-code school hours, after-care, sports, music lessons, therapy appointments, and the weekly visit to the other parent’s home. Overlay the two adult schedules on top. Gaps will appear like negative space in a photograph; those are the danger zones where a child can end up waiting on a curb or standing in an empty kitchen. The helper will prompt you to brainstorm bridging strategies: a neighbor who can accept delivery of a clarinet, a car-pool rotation that buys each parent two free afternoons per month, an employer who allows a 9:30 start on Wednesdays if the shift ends at six instead of five. Each concession becomes a Lego brick in a stronger co-parenting structure.\n\nRemember to preserve white space. A schedule crammed edge-to-edge leaves no room for stomach bugs, flat tires, or the sudden urge to build the world’s largest cardboard castle. Experts recommend leaving at least one unclaimed ninety-minute block per day and one completely free evening per week. Guard these fiercely; they are the pressure valves that keep the household from blowing open during finals week or quarterly report crunch.\n\nTechnology can be an ally, but only if both parents pledge allegiance to the same app. Shared calendar programs that ping both phones when soccer practice changes location prevent the avalanche of “I thought you had her” texts. Yet digital tools work only when coupled with a weekly fifteen-minute stand-up meeting—held over coffee while the child watches Saturday cartoons—where the upcoming schedule is reviewed and updated. Make this ritual as sacred as any boardroom gathering; skipping it is the fastest way to spiral back into chaos.\n\nEventually the grid will feel less like a cage and more like a jazz score: structured enough to keep the rhythm, flexible enough to allow solos. You will know you have succeeded when your child can recite the schedule as easily as the days of the week: “Mondays Mom packs the snacks, Tuesdays Dad drives the car-pool, Wednesdays I go straight to chess club.” That predictability breeds security, and security frees mental bandwidth for the fun parts of parenting—the spontaneous ice-cream detour, the twilight catch in the park, the whispered confession about the first crush—because the logistical backbone is already in place.\n\nKeep the schedule alive by reviewing it every season. When daylight lengthens, when hockey gives way to lacrosse, when a promotion adds an evening class, pull out the grid again. Invite the helper back if tension creeps in; even veterans need tune-ups. Over years the colors on the chart will shift, but the process remains the same: measure, negotiate, write it down, and trust that the minutes you give to planning tonight return themselves tenfold in calm tomorrow.", "cost": 0.002006, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:forbidden_words", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"forbidden_words": ["sleep", "cook", "feed"]}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "schedule", "frequency": 6}], "result": true}

Answer this easy question first, then expand into an interesting article about salmon and avocado. Use some words in all caps in your response, but those all-caps words should appear at most 10 times.", "response": "AVOCADO is not a fish.\n\n---\n\nSALMON VS. AVOCADO: A TALE OF TWO SUPERFOODS THAT COULDN’T BE MORE DIFFERENT\n\nLet’s start with the obvious: SALMON is a silvery, cold-water warrior that slices through rivers and oceans, while AVOCADO is a buttery, tree-hugging fruit that never leaves its branch until it’s PICKED. One has fins, the other has a pit. One breathes through gills, the other “breathes” through pores in its skin. Yet both end up on the same breakfast plate—smashed on toast, sliced beside a bagel, or rolled into a sushi maki—where their flavors COLLIDE in ways that make taste buds dance.\n\nSALMON: THE SWIMMING PROTEIN PILL  \nWild SALMON can leap waterfalls taller than a one-story house, navigating by magnetoreception and an almost MYTHIC homing instinct that brings it back to the exact gravel bed where it was born. That journey loads its flesh with omega-3s—those celebrated fatty acids that cool inflammation, lubricate neurons, and make cardiologists SMILE. A 100 g serving of wild SALMON delivers roughly 25 g of complete protein plus vitamin D, B12, and a day's worth of marine magic.\n\nAVOCADO: THE GREEN GOLD  \nThe word comes from the Nahuatl āhuacatl, which also meant “testicle”—a nod to the fruit’s SHAPE and its reputation as an Aztec aphrodisiac. Beneath its pebbly jacket lies a lipid profile so gentle that dietitians call it “plant butter.” Monounsaturated oleic acid—also found in olive oil—helps AVOCADO lower LDL cholesterol while keeping HDL happily afloat. Add potassium (more gram-for-gram than a banana), lutein for EYE health, and fiber that feeds gut microbes, and you have a fruit that acts like a multivit wearing a velvet tracksuit.\n\nFROM RIVER TO TREE: A SHARED CULTURAL CURRENT  \nIn the 1990s, California sushi bars started pairing AVOCADO with SALMON in “California rolls” as a diplomatic bridge for Americans wary of raw fish. The creamy flesh tamed the oceanic punch, creating a gateway bite that launched a thousand sushi bars across the Midwest. Today, SALMON-AVOCADO toast is Instagram’s most-liked brunch, green and coral swirls that photograph like edible SUNSET.\n\nSUSTAINABILITY CHECK  \nNot all SALMON is created equal: wild Alaskan stocks are stringently managed, while some open-net Atlantic farms still battle sea-lice and antibiotic overuse. AVOCADO faces its own squeeze—every kiln-dried fruit shipped from Michoacán to Minneapolis demands about 70 L of water, and expanding orchards have nudged Mexican forests, sparking fair-trade initiatives that pay farmers to keep native pines standing. The takeaway? Check for MSC (Marine Stewardship Council) on your SALMON and Rainforest Alliance or Equal Exchange seals on your AVOCADO.\n\nCULINARY PLAYBOOK  \n1. COLD-PREP: Cube ripe AVOCADO and cured SALMON, fold with lime, dill, and a dash of soy for a five-minute ceviche.  \n2. HOT-SEAR: Paint a SALMON fillet with miso, sear skin-side down until CRISPY, then nestle on a puree of AVOCADO warmed just enough to release nutty aromas—avocado doesn’t oxidize if you add a squeeze of citrus.  \n3. SWEET: Blend frozen AVOCADO with cocoa and maple; top with SALMON-skin “bacon” candied in brown sugar—savory-sweet umami that will CONFUSE and delight dessert addicts.\n\nFUN FACTS TO DROP AT DINNER  \n• A single AVOCADO is botanically a single-seeded berry.  \n• SALMON can change the color of their flesh based on diet: krill-heavy meals create deeper ORANGE.  \n• The Aztec symbol for fertility was a pair of intertwined AVOCADOS; in Pacific Northwest lore, SALMON are seen as returning ancestors.\n\nBOTTOM LINE  \nOne gives you marine muscle, the other terrestrial velvet. Together they form a nutritional yin-yang: omega-3s plus oleic acid, complete protein plus fiber, river drama plus orchard calm. Eat both, but eat them WISELY—choose sustainably, season boldly, and remember that the only thing they truly share is the ability to turn an ordinary Tuesday into something WORTH posting.", "cost": 0.0019635, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:capital_word_frequency", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"capital_relation": "less than", "capital_frequency": 11}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 1}], "result": false}

Staff—recognizable by their neon [uniform color] shirts—invite you to stroke the bumpy carapace of a horseshoe crab that predates dinosaurs.

Jellyfish Gallery: Planetarium of the Sea  \nStep into a darkened room lit only by back-lit tanks where moon jellies, sea walnuts, and the notorious Portuguese man-o-war drift like lava lamps from Poseidon’s dorm room. The soundtrack is an ambient remix of [chart-topping song] played at 60 bpm—scientifically proven to slow human heart rates to match the jellies’ hypnotic pulse.\n\n5. Sleepovers & Yoga: Yes, You Can Namaste Next to a Octopus  \nOnce a month the lights dim even further for [overnight program name], a family-friendly sleepover beneath the shark tunnel. Wake up to sunrise yoga on the acrylic floor while cownose rays wing-eclipse your downward dog. Slots fill in [number] minutes, so set an alarm for registration day.\n\n6.

Your article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "The Reality of Disability  \nBy A. Witness\n\nDisability is not a metaphor, a cautionary tale, or a plucky after-school special. It is 1.3 billion people—one in six of us—moving through a world that was not built for our bodies, senses, or minds. It is the texture of ordinary days that can suddenly become extraordinary because a curb has no cut, an elevator is out of order, or a website refuses to speak to a screen reader. It is also the quiet triumph of finding a back entrance that isn’t locked, a stranger who knows how to communicate in sign, or a boss who doesn’t treat a day off for chemotherapy as a vacation.\n\nThe first reality is statistical, but statistics rarely stay in the body. Around 240 million children live with disabilities; in most countries they are less likely to attend school and more likely to be sexually assaulted. In the United States, 70 percent of adults with disabilities are “able to work and want to work,” yet only 19 percent are employed. These numbers are not passive; they are the result of policy choices, budgeting decisions, architectural laziness, and storytelling that renders us either invisible or inspirational for tying our own shoes.\n\nThe second reality is temporal. Everyone who lives long enough will join the community of disabled people. Aging into disability is the most common demographic prediction no political campaign addresses. Yet planning for this transition—how we will bathe, cook, vote, love, and die with dignity—is framed as a “special interest” instead of a universal design challenge. The curb you cruise over on your bicycle at twenty-five is the same curb you may crawl over at eighty-five. The microphone that fails to caption a conference speaker today will be the same microphone that fails you when your hearing begins its slow fade.\n\nThe third reality is corporeal. Pain is not romantic; fatigue is not poetic. Spasticity at 3 a.m. does not feel like a lesson. It feels like a thigh muscle clenched so hard it fractures a femur, or a bladder infection climbing toward your kidneys because the accessible bathroom in the bar is locked “to keep junkies out.” Our bodies are not site maps for someone else’s empathy training. They are sites of intimacy, surgery scars that itch when it rains, residual limbs that still try to balance in dreams, and insulin pumps that beep like a heart murmur during first dates. We are neither broken nor “perfectly abled underneath”; we are whole organisms negotiating a hostile environment.\n\nThe fourth reality is political. Disability rights are civil rights, but they are still treated as charity. In 2023, the U.S. Senate voted against ratifying the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for the fifth time. Meanwhile, police continue to kill people experiencing mental-health crises because de-escalation training is optional but Tasers are standard issue. In Uganda, the president signs an anti-LGBTQ+ law that criminalizes “promoting” homosexuality, and disabled queer people disappear into double closets. In Japan, 20,000 people with disabilities were involuntarily sterilized between 1949 and 1994; the government apologized in 2019 but refused to pay compensation. History is not past; it is archived in our bones.\n\nThe fifth reality is creative. Deaf gain, crip wisdom, and neurodivergent coding languages are reshaping art, science, and community. Composer Dame Evelyn Glennie performs percussion barefoot so sound vibrations travel through her bones. Autistic climate activist Dara McAnulty writes prose so sensorily precise it makes boreal forests legible to policy makers. The rolling dance collective Kinetic Light turns wheelchair ramps into aerial stages, proving that gravity can be queered. These are not exceptions; they are previews of what abundance looks like when access is assumed, not grudgingly granted.\n\nThe final reality is intimate. Love happens, and it is complicated. Care happens, and it is also labor. Disabled people date, marry, have one-night stands, produce children, adopt, divorce, and ghost one another like anyone else. But we also negotiate contracts with personal-care assistants who may leave overnight WhatsApp messages reading, “I can’t come tomorrow; my kid is sick,” forcing us to choose between a day without toileting and begging a stranger on Craigslist. We field questions from potential lovers: “Can you have sex?” (Yes, but not with you until you learn how to ask.) We balance SSDI marriage penalties that can dock benefits if we wed, as though chronic illness were a dowry the state insists on keeping.\n\nDisability is not a gift bestowed by providence to teach the rest of humanity gratitude. Nor is it a tragedy that converts neatly into a GoFundMe. It is the ordinary pulse of difference, the price and the prize of being flesh. It is what happens when the world pretends that bodies are predictable and minds are infinitely compliant. Accepting its reality means rebuilding everything—sidewalks, algorithms, economies, and fantasies—so that no one has to flatten their story into inspiration porn just to get groceries.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?", "cost": 0.0021525, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Is there anything else I can help with?"}], "result": true}

Here are the top hits from my rolling reality show:\n\n1. The Rat Who Knew Parkour  \n   9:47 a.m., downtown 4 train. A rat the size of a foot-long sandwich drops from the ceiling vent, lands on a sleeping commuter’s lap, parkours across three poles, and exits at Wall Street like it’s late for a board meeting. The car erupts in a standing ovation; the rat left behind a single, glittering sequin that nobody claims.\n\n2. The Wedding Reception That Wasn’t  \n   Q35 bus to Rockaway, summer solstice. A full wedding party—bride, groom, six bridesmaids in sea-foam green—boards with a bluetooth speaker and a tiered cake. They sing, dance, and cut the cake using a塑料地铁卡 (plastic MetroCard) as a knife. When asked why, the groom shrugs: “Venue fell through. The bus *is* the venue now.” Strangers end up forming a conga line down the aisle; the driver gets off at the beach and joins the photos.\n\n3. The Librarian of the L Train  \n   Every Thursday night, a woman sets up a free, pop-up library in the last car: milk crates of paperbacks, battery-powered lamps, and a rubber stamp that says “Return to the L.” Borrowers sign with Sharpie on the wall. Once I found a 1972 first-edition Borges sandwiched between a tax code manual and someone’s grocery list. I still have it; she still has my email.\n\n4. The Astronomy Club at 2 a.m.  \n   Last winter, the B61 night bus turned into a rolling planetarium. A teenager unrolls a star map across the rear window, points a green laser at the condensation, and delivers an impromptu lecture on Orion while the driver dims the interior lights. By the end of the route half the passengers can find Betelgeuse without Google.\n\n5. The Silent Disco Express  \n   A-car on the A train, 3 a.m. New Year’s Day. Ninety people in wireless neon headphones sway to synchronized playlists only they can hear. To outsiders it looks like mass hallucination; to us it’s the freshest club in the city, rattling under the East River with zero cover charge.\n\n6. The Time I Became the Route  \n   Riding the 24-hour Staten Island loop for a story, I dozed off and woke up to the driver announcing, “Next stop: wherever she’s going.” The entire bus had voted to keep rolling until I opened my eyes. When I finally got off at 5:11 a.m., they cheered like I’d finished a marathon. I still don’t know if I was passenger or prophet.\n\n7. The Departure Board of Lost & Found  \n   Grand Central Shuttle, main concourse display. Someone hacked the LED board to scroll: “You left your umbrella, your ex’s hoodie, and the novel you swear you’ll finish. Collect all three before the next express departs for your future.” By rush hour, every item on the list had been reclaimed except the ex.\n\nI used to think public transit was just A-to-B.

{"id": 152, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write an essay of at least 900 words on the topic of navigable freeway. Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", "response": "a navigable freeway is more than a strip of asphalt; it is a living artery, a public text that rewrites itself every rush hour. it is the place where civil engineering meets psychology, where the geometry of merge lanes collides with the geometry of desire. we think we know it—this wide, banked, sign-posted thing—but the moment we try to fix it in language it starts to shimmer and shift, like heat rising off the crown of the road in august. to call a freeway “navigable” is already to admit that it is a kind of inland sea, a moving surface across which drivers pilot fragile metal boats, steering by stars made of reflective lane dots. the metaphor is not poetic excess; it is the only way to account for what actually happens when seventy miles per hour becomes the baseline speed of citizenship.\n\nfirst, let us strip away the myth that the freeway is a single, coherent object. instead, imagine it as a stack of translucent maps laid one on top of another. the bottom sheet is the oldest: a mid-century engineering drawing showing 12-foot lanes, 1959 ford fairlanes drifting at 50 mph, and a modest interchange drawn in calm pencil. the next sheet is 1974: energy crisis, 55 mph national limit, car radios crackling with watergate hearings. another sheet: 1986, the year the first loop detectors were embedded in the pavement, turning the road into a digital sponge that could soak up data about occupancy and flow. keep flipping up through the stack—1994 smart studs, 2005 ipod playlists, 2013 google fleet priuses logging every lane change—until you reach the top, the sheet labeled now. on this surface, the same physical corridor is simultaneously a truck route, a mom’s grocery run, an amazon delivery algorithm, and a teenager’s tiktok backdrop. the navigable freeway is thus a palimpsest, never finished, always being annotated by the next trip, the next upgrade, the next crisis.\n\nnavigation, then, is not simply the act of following green boards that promise “north 95.” it is the continuous interpretation of this palimpsest. consider the commuter who leaves her house at 6:47 a.m. she thinks she is driving to work, but she is also reading the freeway like a seer reading tea leaves. she notes the brake-light constellation blooming ahead, decodes the queue-length at the on-ramp meter, tastes the change in asphalt age by the slightly rougher ride at mile 17.3. she is unaware that her car’s bluetooth is pinging the roadside beacon every 1.5 seconds, feeding a traffic management algorithm that will, in five minutes, open the shoulder as an extra lane three miles behind her. she is both reader and co-author of the text, her presence altering the story for everyone downstream. the freeway is navigable only because millions of these unconscious co-authors agree, moment by moment, to keep the narrative coherent. one rogue pickup, one overturned propane truck, and the entire novel collapses into a single sentence of red tail-lights.\n\nthis brings us to the question of thresholds. how much congestion can the story absorb before the freeway becomes unnavigable? engineers speak of “level of service,” a letter grade from a (free flow) to f (gridlock). but drivers feel it differently. the threshold is auditory: when the white noise of tires changes pitch, when the stereo can no longer compete, when the car becomes a drum. it is also temporal: when the expected arrival time drifts past the duration of the average pop song, when the mind starts to inventory the glove compartment for snacks, when the commuter begins to calculate the cost of being late against the cost of abandoning the freeway and cutting across surface streets. the navigable freeway exists in the fragile interval before that calculation tilts toward exit. it is a psychic contract: we agree to believe that the jam will break, that the next crest will reveal open asphalt, that the story will restore its promised velocity. once that belief drains away, the freeway is no longer a freeway; it is a parking lot with existential signage.\n\ntechnology keeps redrawing the contract. adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and crowd-sourced rerouting apps extend the threshold, the way stronger levees extend the floodplain. they allow us to tolerate higher densities before we lose faith. but they also raise the stakes. a 1960 driver stalled in a 20-minute jam felt frustration; a 2023 driver, told by her dashboard that eta has ballooned from 28 to 53 minutes, feels betrayal. the more precisely the system predicts, the more visceral the deviation feels. paradoxically, the freeway becomes less forgiving as it becomes smarter. we are approaching a moment when the road will speak to the car in full sentences—“i am closing the left two lanes at marker 142 due to debris”—and the car will answer—“acknowledged, rerouting to express lanes via ramp b.” when that dialogue is ubiquitous, the human driver will be demoted from co-author to passenger inside her own vehicle. the freeway will still be navigable, but the navigator will be an array of lidar sensors and cloud-based hive maps. the romance of the road will migrate from the steering wheel to the algorithm.\n\nyet even an algorithm must negotiate the physical skeleton of the corridor. concrete bridges age; asphalt ruts; expansion joints oxidize. the navigable freeway is therefore also an exercise in deferred maintenance, a bet against entropy. every lane-mile demands about 6,000 gallons of diesel-equivalent energy to reconstruct, and america has roughly 50,000 lane-miles of interstate. do the math and you glimpse the shadow budget beneath the asphalt: millions of barrels of oil that must stay in the ground if the climate is to remain hospitable to freeways at all. the road, then, is locked in a race with its own footprint. it can remain navigable only if we find ways to keep it cool—cooler paving mixes, lighter vehicles, maybe even lanes that double as solar arrays, feeding electrons back to the cars that roll above them. the freeway of 2050 might carry three times the traffic at half the carbon cost, but only if we accept that the surface itself must become a power plant, a data conduit, and a botanical host to photocatalytic grasses that digest nox into nitrates. the road will photosynthesize, in its own mechanistic way.\n\nin the meantime, the human animal still seeks meaning between the guardrails. teenagers graffiti overpasses with tags that are essentially love letters to the flow: “born to lose, built to cruise.” roadside shrines—white crosses, plastic flowers, faded polaroids—mark spots where navigation failed. these miniature cemeteries remind us that every merge is a moral act, every lane change a piece of choreography in a dance of mutual survival. the navigable freeway is thus also a curriculum in citizenship. it teaches us to modulate space at 80 feet per second, to signal intent with a blink, to forgive the stranger who cuts us off because tomorrow it will be us drifting across the gore line, distracted by a push notification. the road is the place where the abstract idea of the social contract becomes a concrete slab. we consent to be governed by dashed white lines, and in return the lines grant us velocity, horizon, the illusion of autonomy.\n\nthere is, finally, the moment after exit, when the driver rolls down the ramp and the engine note drops. the freeway recedes into the rearview mirror, a river still flowing without her. she will complain about the jam, forget the open stretch, and queued again tomorrow. but some particles of that experience stay lodged: the muscle memory of the perfect merge, the glimpse of a hawk circling above the median, the lottery of license plates from distant states. these fragments are the interest on the psychic mortgage we pay every day. they remind us that the navigable freeway is not only infrastructure; it is also a collective unconscious, a rolling anthology of exit dreams. we navigate it, yes, but it navigates us—gives us coordinates for ambition, disappointment, and return. long after the last internal-combustion engine sputters into silence, when the asphalt is laced with wireless inductive coils and the air smells faintly of ozone instead of diesel, people will still speak of making good time, of hitting the road, of finding a lane that moves. the freeway will still be there, palimpsest renewed, inviting the next traveler to decode the shapes of tail-lights against the dark, to steer by the reflective dots that pretend to be stars.", "cost": 0.0036005, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 900}], "result": true}

Our mission statement: “Brew equality, serve joy, and pour back into our queer community—one cup, one conversation, one donated dollar at a time.” We operate as a for-profit B-Corp with a 60 % queer/trans staff and a profit-sharing model that donates 10 % of net monthly earnings to local mutual-aid funds for housing–insecure LGBTQIA+ youth.\n\nSECTION 2  \nMenu & Vendors  \nCoffee & Tea: Single-origin beans from “Out&About Coffee Co-op” (LGBTQ-owned importer, fair-trade, carbon-neutral shipping).

At Stripe I led a 6-engineer squad that cut API latency 42 % by rewriting hot-paths to use gRPC and Firestore; the change now processes $2 B in annual volume. I have contributed 40+ patches to Kubernetes, authored OpenTelemetry exporters, and speak three natural languages—just like Google Search.\n\nI want to build the next generation of planet-scale products at Google. My résumé is attached; code at github.com/[handle]. I am available immediately for phone or onsite interviews.\n\nThank you for your time.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n<<Expanded Cover Letter – Google Software Engineer>>\n[Your Name]\n[Street Address]\n[City, State ZIP]\n[Phone] | [Email] | linkedin.com/in/[handle] | github.com/[handle]\n[Date]\n\nGoogle Engineering Hiring Committee\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\nMountain View, California 94043\n\nDear Members of the Engineering Hiring Committee,\n\nStory matters at Google. From “10 blue links” to autonomous Waymo rides, the company turns bold ideas into infrastructure that billions trust every day. I am writing to add my own chapter to that story by bringing my experience designing fault-tolerant, planet-scale services to the Software Engineering team.\n\nWHY I AM READY\nI have spent the past six years turning ambiguity into reliable code at high-growth technology companies. After graduating with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois (GPA 3.9/4.0, Bronze Tablet), I joined Stripe as one of the first 200 engineers. There, I:\n\n• Re-architected the core payments orchestration service (Golang, protobuf) to handle a 10× traffic spike, growing from 400 to 4 000 QPS without a single rollback.  \n  – Introduced streaming event sourcing with Kafka, idempotent sagas, and circuit breakers that lowered p99 latency 42 % and eliminated $2 M/month in transaction time-outs.  \n• Led a cross-functional squad of 6 engineers and 2 PMs across San Francisco, Dublin, and Singapore; instituted weekly “design previews” that cut review cycles by 30 %.  \n• Contributed 40+ commits to open-source Kubernetes, including a scheduler fix that prevents pre-emption starvation on large clusters; patch adopted by GKE.  \n• Filed two patents (US 16/xxxxxx) on dynamic risk-based routing for financial APIs; system now under evaluation for Google Cloud Payments.\n\nWHAT I CAN BRING TO GOOGLE\n1. Distributed-systems fluency. I have debugged consensus edge cases at 3 a.m. and written design docs that survive both SRE and security review.  \n2. User-centered optimization. My side-project, “PerfViz,” a Chrome extension that overlays Core Web Vitals on live pages, was downloaded 18 000 times and featured in the Chrome Dev Summit.  \n3. Inclusion leadership. As Stripe Pride co-president I scaled ally workshops from 40 to 400 participants; I want to amplify Google’s culture of belonging.\n\nWHY GOOGLE NOW\nThe company’s shift to a “AI-first” world is redefining how humanity accesses knowledge. Whether improving Search latency in emerging markets, hardening Borg for planet-scale ML training, or weaving privacy into FLOC-based advertising, Google tackles problems whose answers become tomorrow’s standards. I want to write the code that researchers cite, competitors emulate, and teachers use as classroom examples.\n\nPOSITIONS OF INTEREST\nI am excited about Serverless, Search Infrastructure, Core AI Platforms, or Pixel System Software; I am happy to pivot based on organizational need. My long-term goal is to become a TL/Manager who still commits code—someone who scales both systems and people.\n\nNEXT STEPS\nI will be in Mountain View the week of 18 March and can interview on site or via Google Meet at your convenience. I have attached my résumé, design-doc portfolio, and links to open-source contributions. I am authorized to work in the United States and can join as early as 15 May.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of helping Google build what’s next—for everyone.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]", "cost": 0.0020285000000000004, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

He didn’t hit snooze. That was the first lie he’d stopped telling himself. He rolled out of bed, toes meeting the cold laminate floor he’d mopped the night before, and felt the tiny thrill of a life still rickety but no longer collapsing. \n\nSix months ago, the apartment had been a landfill of pizza boxes, court notices, and a single cracked photograph of his daughter, Willa, age six, smiling as if she’d never learned the word “visitation.” Now the boxes were flattened in the recycling bin, the notices were folded into a folder labeled “Handle,” and Willa’s picture sat in a new frame on the windowsill that caught the sunrise.\n\nMarcus made coffee—one scoop, not three—and opened the spreadsheet he’d titled “Reassembly.” Rows tracked everything: sobriety days (187), push-ups (53 this morning), dollars in the emergency fund ($1,247.83), and boxes still unchecked: GED, driver’s license reinstatement, Willa’s custody. He allowed himself ten minutes to stare at the red blanks, then closed the laptop so the day couldn’t shrink into pixels.\n\nBy 7:15 he was on the early bus to the warehouse. The job was temporary—inventory scanning for a big-box chain—but it was the first place that hadn’t asked about felonies in the first five minutes. He wore the lanyard like a sheriff’s badge. During break, instead of sneaking a vape, he practiced fractions on greasy napkins: If Willa is 9 now and I’m 32, how old will we both be when I can take her to the zoo without a chaperone? The answer kept moving, but he kept doing the math.\n\nLunch was two hard-boiled eggs and a thermos of water. Leon, a co-worker with a graying braid, nodded at the eggs and said, “You lookin’ different, man. Lighter.” Marcus almost cracked a smile, but instead he asked Leon how long he’d been clean. Leon said, “Twenty-four years, one day at a time.” Marcus wrote that on a napkin and stuffed it in his pocket so the sentence could ride against his thigh all afternoon.\n\nAfter the shift, Marcus walked the two miles to the community college instead of transferring to the bus that would take him home. The lobby smelled like chalk dust and ambition. He sat in the admissions office with his hands flat on his knees, palms damp. The advisor, Ms. Jimenez, had a bob that reminded him of Willa’s mother the year they met, before everything curdled. Ms. Jimenez didn’t flinch when he said he’d left school in tenth grade. She circled two evening classes: Basic Math Refresher, English Comp. “Start small,” she said, sliding the paper across the desk as if it were a life preserver. He folded it into the same pocket that held Leon’s sentence, layers of paper now pulsing like a second heart.\n\nThat night, he sat at the kitchen table with the GED study guide he’d checked out from the library. The word problems tried to trick him with trains and intersecting tracks, but he’d lived trickier. He worked one problem, then another, until the numbers stopped swimming.

{"id": 1643, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "\"Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.\" What are your thoughts on this quote? Please do not use commas in your response. Answer with more than 800 words.", "response": "I take the sentence as a poetic attempt to make sense of the strange intersections that pepper human experience.  When two long lost friends bump into each other in a foreign airport or when a delayed train causes someone to miss a deadly accident people often call the event a coincidence.  The quote says that such moments are not random but are instead subtle signatures left by a divine author who prefers to stay hidden.\n\nHistory is filled with stories that look like finely plotted novels.  A teenage boy in Poland named Karol Wojtyła decides to enter an underground seminary during World War Two.  The Nazis wipe out most of the clergy yet he survives.  Decades later he becomes Pope John Paul II and survives an assassination attempt on the exact anniversary of the Virgin of Fatima.  A believer can look at that layered timing and see a quiet artist arranging events from behind a curtain.  A skeptic can look at the same data and say that the planet holds eight billion lives so patterns are inevitable.  Both responses live inside the same moment which is why the sentence provokes wonder and argument at once.\n\nThe idea of a hidden god is old.  In the Bible the prophet Elijah stands on a mountain waiting for the Holy.  There is wind fire and earthquake yet the text says God is in none of those.  Instead the divine arrives as what the Hebrew calls a still small voice a gentle breeze that is almost missed.  The story trains the reader to expect the sacred in the understated.  Centuries later the Muslim thinker Al Ghazali writes that every leaf falls according to two motions the physical law and the secret decree.  The first motion is visible the second is known only to the Knower.  The quote we are examining modernizes this intuition by dressing it in twentieth century clothes.\n\nScience gives us probability theory which is brilliant at explaining bulk behavior.  Flip a fair coin a thousand times and you will almost certainly see a run of seven heads in a row.  That run feels spooky to the person flipping yet mathematicians can predict its appearance.  The trouble starts when the single story matters more than the statistical ensemble.  A cancer patient who recovers after a chance encounter with a stranger who offers the perfect advice does not care about global averages.  For that one life the event is everything.  The believer calls it grace the statistician calls it an outlier and the poet calls it anonymous godwork.\n\nNeuroscience adds another layer.  The human brain is an apophenia machine wired to spot faces in clouds and tigers in rustling leaves.  Survival once depended on seeing patterns even when they were not there.  Today that legacy means we experience coincidences as electric jolts of meaning.  MRI studies show that the parietal cortex lights up when people feel a sense of transcendent connection.  Whether the pattern is cosmic or illusory the neurological glow is identical.  So perhaps the sentence is less about metaphysics and more about inner architecture.  Even if that is true the sense of wonder remains and wonder is valuable whether or not it points to an actual agent.\n\nEthics also enters the room.  If I treat every lucky break as a whispered instruction I may become more humble more grateful and more willing to help the next person.  The opposite danger is passivity.  Someone might decide that because life is choreographed by an unseen director personal effort is pointless.  History shows that communities who trust too deeply in fate can stagnate.  The quote therefore needs a dance partner called responsibility.  Maybe the hidden god hides on purpose so that humans will cultivate courage compassion and creativity rather than waiting for thunderbolts of proof.\n\nLiterature circles around the same theme.  In Les Misérables Victor Hugo arranges for Jean Valjean to be caught by the bishop who then saves his soul with silver candlesticks.  Hugo calls the moment a coincidence yet the entire novel insists that this apparent accident launches Valjean on a sacred quest.  Tolkien places Bilbo at the right crack in the mountain so that he finds the One Ring.  The wizard Gandalf later confesses that such luck feels like the hand of something higher.  Both authors refuse to name the hand yet they let the reader feel its pressure.  In that sense the sentence is not a theological claim it is a narrative instinct shared across cultures.\n\nMy own life contains small intersections that look trivial on paper yet felt charged.  I once took a wrong turn in a city I did not know and found an old teacher sitting alone on a bench.  We talked and the conversation altered the course of my studies.  If traffic lights had been greener I would have zipped past the bench and the conversation would never have happened.  Retrospectively I can weave that moment into a grand story about vocation.  Prospectively it was nothing more than a left instead of a right.  The quote licenses me to keep both lenses in focus and to let the mystery breathe.\n\nCultures differ in how much anonymity they assign to the divine.  In many Indigenous traditions the spirits are highly visible speaking through wind animal and dream.  In Theravada Buddhism the cosmos is governed by impersonal law so coincidence is simply karmic fruit ripening without any manager backstage.  The Japanese concept of musibi describes the unseen knot that ties people together but the knot is more like energy than like a person.  The sentence we are pondering is therefore rooted in a monotheistic imagination where a single will chooses secrecy.  Exported into plural contexts it becomes metaphor rather than doctrine.\n\nLanguage itself is an enabler of anonymity.  The word coincidence comes from the Latin co and incidere meaning to fall together.  The image is of two trajectories that land in the same spot.  The verb fall implies no pilot yet our ears hear suggestion.  In English we say things fall into place which hints at an invisible placemaker.  The sentence about anonymity weaponizes that hidden echo inside everyday vocabulary.\n\nPractical takeaway begins with humility.  Recognizing that my plans can be derailed or rescued by forces I do not control keeps arrogance in check.  A second lesson is attentiveness.  If the divine or the universe or the narrative impulse chooses subtle channels then I need to refine my inner microphone.  Journaling conversation and stillness become technologies for detecting quiet choreography.  Finally the quote invites participation.  Perhaps I am not only a reader of coincidences but also a coauthor.  When I offer timely help or speak an apparently random word of encouragement I may be extending the anonymous signature through my own hand.\n\nIn the end the sentence is less an argument than a doorway.  It stands at the crossroads of statistics and story logic and destiny.  Some will walk through the doorway and sense warm light.  Others will see only weather and neural sparks.  The beauty is that both groups still share the same street corner where two paths unexpectedly meet.  The meeting itself is the fact the interpretation is the art.  And perhaps the anonymous artist whether divine or human or both smiles every time someone pauses on that corner and whispers thank you to whoever may be listening.", "cost": 0.0029585, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 801}], "result": true}

Make sure that it's in English and not a single letter in your entire response is capitalized whatsoever.", "response": "martin van buren, eighth president of the united states, assumed office on march 4, 1837, inheriting a nation brimming with economic prosperity and political turbulence. his presidency, lasting a single term, unfolded against the backdrop of the devastating panic of 1837, a financial crisis that would come to define his tenure and tarnish his legacy. van buren, a man of diminutive stature but considerable political acumen, had served as andrew jackson's handpicked successor, yet the economic storm he faced would test his leadership in ways unforeseen.\n\nborn in kinderhook, new york, in 1782, van buren rose through the ranks of new york politics, earning the moniker \"the little magician\" for his skill in political maneuvering. his ascent to the presidency marked a significant moment, as he became the first president born after the declaration of independence and the first not of british descent, his family tracing their roots to the dutch settlers of new amsterdam. this heritage shaped his worldview, instilling in him a belief in restrained government and fiscal prudence, principles that would guide his presidency even as they contributed to his political downfall.\n\nthe panic of 1837 erupted mere weeks into van buren's administration, triggered by a complex web of factors including land speculation, unstable banking practices, and the withdrawal of federal funds from the second bank of the united states. unlike his predecessor, who had dismantled the national bank, van buren faced the consequences of jacksonian financial policies. the crisis manifested in bank failures, widespread unemployment, and plummeting agricultural prices, plunging the nation into its worst economic downturn to that point. van buren's response, while principled, proved politically disastrous.\n\nrather than embrace aggressive intervention, van buren adhered to jacksonian principles of limited government. he proposed the establishment of an independent treasury system, a plan that would divorce government finances from private banks and hold federal funds in government vaults. this stance, while fiscally conservative, struck many as callous amidst widespread suffering. the independent treasury act, passed in 1840, represented van buren's signature achievement, yet it failed to alleviate economic hardship, instead prolonging the depression by restricting credit and maintaining hard money policies.\n\nforeign affairs during van buren's presidency remained largely uneventful, though several incidents tested his diplomatic resolve. the most notable occurred in 1837 when a rebellion erupted in upper canada against british rule. american sympathizers, known as \"patriots,\" crossed the border to support the rebels, leading to tensions with britain. van buren's handling of the affair demonstrated his commitment to neutrality, as he dispatched general winfield scott to prevent american involvement, thereby avoiding potential war. similarly, he navigated the \"caroline affair,\" in which british forces destroyed an american steamer aiding canadian rebels, with diplomatic finesse, ultimately securing an apology from britain.\n\ndomestically, van buren faced significant challenges beyond the economic crisis. the annexation of texas, a priority for many expansionists, stalled during his administration due to northern opposition to admitting another slave state. van buren, aware of the sectional tensions slavery provoked, pursued a cautious approach, prioritizing national unity over territorial expansion. this stance, while preserving the union's fragile peace, alienated southern democrats who viewed him as insufficiently supportive of their interests. additionally, his administration confronted the amistad case, a legal battle involving enslaved africans who had seized control of a spanish ship. van buren's justice department argued for their return to spain, but the supreme court, influenced by abolitionist legal arguments, ruled in favor of the captives' freedom, highlighting the growing national divide over slavery.\n\npolitically, van buren's presidency marked the maturation of the democratic party system he had helped construct. yet, the economic downturn eroded public confidence, and the whig opposition, capitalizing on widespread discontent, branded him \"martin van ruin.\" the election of 1840 saw van buren defeated by william henry harrison, a whig war hero whose campaign introduced modern techniques of mass appeal, including songs, slogans, and imagery that transformed american political culture. van buren's loss signified not merely personal failure but the limits of jacksonian democracy in addressing economic crisis.\n\nin the years following his presidency, van buren remained active in politics, notably opposing the annexation of texas and the mexican-american war, positions that aligned him with anti-slavery forces. his later career reflected the evolution of his political thought, as he grew increasingly critical of southern dominance within the democratic party. van buren's post-presidential journey saw him explore third-party politics, culminating in his 1848 free soil nomination, though he failed to recapture national office. these efforts, while unsuccessful, cemented his legacy as a principled advocate for restraint in both economic and expansionist ventures.\n\nmartin van buren's presidency, though brief, offers a window into the challenges facing early american leaders as they navigated economic transformation and sectional tensions. his steadfast commitment to limited government, while laudable in theory, proved inadequate to the demands of a nation in crisis. yet, his presidency also demonstrated the resilience of american institutions, as the constitutional system weathered economic storm without succumbing to authoritarian solutions. van buren's story serves as a reminder that leadership, even when principled, may falter when confronted with unprecedented challenges, and that historical judgment often hinges on factors beyond any single leader's control.", "cost": 0.002323, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Please wrap your entire reply with double quotation marks. There should be exactly 6 paragraphs separated by the markdown divider: ***\nIn your response, use words with all capital letters (such as \"RUBRIC\") at least 5 times.", "response": "\"RUBRIC FOR MUSICAL COMPOSITION EVALUATION\nThis RUBRIC is designed to provide clear, consistent criteria for assessing ORIGINAL MUSICAL WORKS across educational, competitive, and professional contexts. Each category is weighted to reflect its impact on the overall artistic and technical success of the piece. Scores range from 1 (EMERGING) to 5 (DISTINGUISHED), allowing evaluators to recognize both achievement and potential. The RUBRIC emphasizes creativity, craftsmanship, and communicative power, ensuring that composers receive balanced feedback that encourages growth while celebrating excellence.\n\n***\n\nMELODY & MOTIVIC DEVELOPMENT (25%)\nA DISTINGUISHED melody is memorable, singable, and organically developed throughout the composition. Evaluators should ask: Does the primary material possess a clear PROFILE and emotional signature? Are motives transformed through inversion, augmentation, sequencing, or fragmentation to maintain interest? At the EMERGING level, melodies may be repetitive or lack directional shape; at the PROFICIENT level they exhibit balanced phrasing and modest variation; EXEMPLARY works reveal innovation, while DISTINGUISHED compositions present melodies that function as unified yet ever-evolving characters across the FORM.\n\n***\n\nHARMONY & COUNTERPOINT (20%)\nThis RUBRIC domain measures the composer’s command of VERTICAL SONORITIES and linear independence. DISTINGUISHED harmonic language extends beyond functional tonality or extends traditional syntax with purposeful non-chord tones, modal mixtures, or fresh chromatic pivots. Counterpoint should be CLEAR, voice-led with minimal parallels, and contribute to TEXTURE rather than clutter. Score each passage: 1 shows basic triads with errors; 3 shows competent functional progressions; 5 reveals adventurous yet coherent harmonic rhythm, subtle dissonance treatment, and contrapuntal textures that enhance EXPRESSIVE INTENT.\n\n***\n\nFORM & STRUCTURE (15%)\nEvaluators examine how well the composition BALANCES unity and variety across time. A DISTINGUISHED piece articulates sections through proportional design (e.g., sonata, rondo, arch, through-composed) while maintaining MOTIVIC integration. Transitions are SEAMLESS, climaxes are prepared and resolved, and proportional timings support narrative arc. An EMERGING work may stop and start without logic; a PROFICIENT work uses clear cadences and some thematic return; EXEMPLARY introduces surprise yet cogent design; DISTINGUISHED achieves architectural elegance where every bar earns its place in the MACRO-RUBRIC of the whole.\n\n***\n\nTEXTURE & ORCHESTRATION / INSTRUMENTATION (15%)\nRegardless of ensemble size, composers must demonstrate aware deployment of TIMBRE, RANGE, and DENSITY. DISTINGUISHED scores exploit instrumental color to clarify thematic layers, avoid muddiness, and create CONTRAST without sacrificing balance. Doublings should be purposeful, extreme registers justified, and spatial effects notated precisely. RUBRIC evaluators listen for transparent middle passages, effective resonance, and idiomatic writing that allows performers to SOUND their best. Reserve the top mark only when the SONIC palette itself becomes part of the composition’s narrative identity.\n\n***\n\nNOTATION, PRESENTATION, & PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS (15%)\nThe RUBRIC demands that creators communicate intent with clarity and respect for performers. DISTINGUISHED scores exhibit accurate clefs, correct transpositions, logical page turns, dynamics beyond mezzoforte stereotypes, and PERFORMANCE NOTES that solve ambiguity. Computer engraving must be CONSISTENT (stem directions, beaming, slurs), and parts must be extracted without collision. An EMERGING submission may omit tempo marks; PROFICIENT shows basic dynamics; EXEMPLARY introduces rehearsal letters and precise articulations; DISTINGUISHED is ready for PUBLICATION without further editorial intervention.\n\n***\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION & EMOTIONAL IMPACT (10%)\nThe final RUBRIC component invites holistic judgment: Does the composition evoke a palpable ATMOSPHERE, stay with the listener, and fulfill its stated aesthetic goal? DISTINGUISHED works transcend technical满分 to achieve MEMORABILITY, cultural resonance, or courageous experimentation that shifts the musical conversation. After scoring the previous five domains, allow this category to calibrate the total, ensuring that a flawlessly notated yet emotionally vacant piece cannot outrank a daring, imperfect manifesto. The ultimate mission of this RUBRIC is to cultivate artists who fuse CRAFT with VISION, giving the world new sounds worth HEARING and REMEMBERING.\"", "cost": 0.001888, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_paragraphs", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_paragraphs": 6}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 5}], "result": false}

{"id": 1730, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post about how to raise awareness for a cause. Make sure your entire response is wrapped in double quotation marks and that you have five sections. Mark the beginning of each section with Section X.", "response": "\"Section 1  \nAwareness is the first domino: until people notice, they cannot care, and until they care, they will not act. Raising awareness for a cause is therefore the invisible architecture that underpins every later victory—donations, policy changes, volunteer hours, and lives saved. Yet “getting the word out” is also the stage where most campaigns stall, reposting the same infographic into the algorithmic void and wondering why nothing moves. The difference between noise and signal lies in strategy, empathy, and relentless creativity. This post breaks the process into five practical sections that you can adapt to any issue—from local river pollution to global refugee rights—without a corporate budget or a celebrity endorsement.\n\nSection 2  \nStart by choosing a single, human-sized story. Neuroscience proves that statistics numb us while narratives energize mirror neurons; one child’s photo next to a polluted creek will outperform a bar chart of ppm toxins. Distill your entire cause into a 12-word “contagious caption” that passes the dinner-table test: would a 14-year-old repeat it? Example: “Flint kids still can’t drink the tap water.” Once the micro-story is airtight, create a visual anchor—an unbranded photo, a 15-second vertical video, a hand-drawn sticker—that can travel across platforms without losing meaning. Release it under a Creative Commons license so strangers become co-owners, not just spectators.\n\nSection 3  \nTurn passive scrolling into active staging. Pick two platforms only—TikTok and email, Instagram and neighborhood Slack, whatever your audience already inhabits—and design a 7-day “awareness staircase.” Day 1: teaser reel asking a question (“Would you drink this?”). Day 2: behind-the-scenes clip showing you collecting water samples. Day 3: user-generated challenge (#TapWaterTasteTest). Day 4: live Q&A with an affected parent. Day 5: downloadable toolkit (poster, flyer, AR filter). Day 6: micro-fundraiser (Venmo/Cash App cap $10). Day 7: public milestone post (photos of bottled water delivered). Each step gives followers a new role—viewer, remixer, donor, advocate—so commitment deepens rather than fatigues.\n\nSection 4  \nOffline alchemy: convert screens into streets. Partner with micro-communities that already gather (bar trivia night, soccer practice, church coffee hour) and offer them a “plug-and-play ritual.” For the water example, provide free printable coasters that reveal a hidden message when wet (“Your water is safe; theirs is not”). Rituals create memory; memory sustains cause. Circulate a 24-hour “flash action” calendar: at 10 a.m. everyone sets an identical phone ringtone (recorded sound of a faucet dripping); when it rings, recipients drop to one knee, post a selfie, tag three friends, donate $5. The synchronized absurdity hacks attention without marching permits or city fees.\n\nSection 5  \nMeasure, iterate, and hand off the mic. Awareness is a relay, not a finish line. Track three metrics only: (1) reach of your micro-story, (2) number of user-generated variants, (3) conversion to concrete next step (petition, donation, meeting attendance). sunset each campaign after 30 days to avoid burnout; release a transparent postmortem—what worked, what bombed, budget spent—so newcomers can copy and improve. Finally, recruit a “successor squad”: five volunteers who did the most remixes, and give them the admin keys and leftover funds. Walk away, start the next cycle, and let the movement outgrow you. Because the best cause awareness is like good compost: it looks like dirt, but it’s alive, warm, and ready to sprout in someone else’s garden.\"", "cost": 0.0016250000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "detectable_format:multiple_sections"], "kwargs": [{}, {"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 5}], "result": true}

One evening she stepped onto the highest balcony, clasped her hands, and called, “Why do you serenade us?”  \nFrom the darkening sky Umbra replied, “Because loneliness burns hotter than flame, and your heart echoes mine.”  \n\nThe knights clanked below, sharpening lances. Linaria’s eyes flashed. She cloaked herself in starlight-blue silk, slipped past the armory, and climbed the observatory stair that no feet but hers had touched since her mother’s death. There she waited until Umbra’s wings eclipsed the moon.  \n\n“Take me with you,” she whispered.  \nUmbra replied with a soft minor chord that meant yes. He lowered a silver-taloned paw; she stepped in as though onto a waiting dance floor. Together they soared above the sleeping city, past farms glazed with dew, until they landed inside a cavern of opal and obsidian.  \n\nInside gleamed a lake lit from beneath by luminous pearls. Umbra sang, and the water rose in crystal staffs, conducting his symphony. Linaria listened until dawn, then said, “If my father’s fear continues, they will find you and ruin this beauty. Let me return and speak for you.”  \n\n“Words alone rarely quench thirst for glory,” Umbra murmured, yet he agreed. He flew her back to the palace roof at sunrise.  \n\nLinaria strode into the throne room unannounced. Knights gasped; the King rose. She lifted her mother’s old crown of woven silver vines, set it upon her own head, and declared, “I have chosen a different quest. I will not marry a prince; I will negotiate peace with our sky-borne neighbor.”  \n\nThe captain scoffed. “Dragons understand only swords.”  \nLinaria smiled. “Then I will speak in the language they do understand—story.”  \n\nShe asked the royal scribe to bring parchment and ink. Upon it she painted not threats but memories: Umbra’s song coaxing winter-stricken buds to bloom, his shadow shielding shepherd boys from sunstroke, his tears crystallizing into moon-opals that farmers sold to buy seed grain. She rolled the parchment into a silver arrow and shot it into the sky at twilight.  \n\nUmbra caught it in his talons, read by starlight, and wept shimmering tears onto the palace orchard. Where they fell, new trees sprouted overnight, heavy with golden fruit that tasted of lullabies.  \n\nWhen the King tasted the fruit, memories of his own mother singing him to sleep returned. His heart softened like wax near flame. He called off the hunt and proclaimed the first Dragon Day: every citizen would bring a poem or song to the palace square, and Umbra would answer from the clouds.  \n\nYears passed; the kingdom grew famous for its music. Travelers came not to conquer but to listen. Linaria remained princess, yet people called her the Lark Regent, for she ruled with a voice rather than a scepter.  \n\nOn the night she came of age, Umbra descended, eyes reflecting torchlight. He bowed low. “My debt to you is deeper than the cavern lake. Ask any wish.”  \n\nLinaria touched the opal pendant he had once gifted her. “Then stay, and when I am gone, sing to my children’s children so they remember that fear replied to with wonder becomes friendship.”  \n\nUmbra inclined his great head. “I replied once in loneliness; I will reply forever in fellowship.”  \n\nAnd so every dusk, violet wings folded above Roselore, harmony spilled across the sky, and the princess and the dragon listened to each other’s hearts until the stars themselves learned the words.", "cost": 0.0017465, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "replied", "frequency": 2}], "result": true}

Apprenticed at twelve to his brother James’s print-shop, he devoured books by candle-stealth, taught himself prose by imitating Addison, and at seventeen fled Puritan discipline for Philadelphia—arriving hungry, wet, and clutching a roll of bread. There his industry quickly caught eyes; he worked through nights, borrowed books, and soon owned his own press. By 1729 he was publisher of The Pennsylvania Gazette, turning it into the colonies’ liveliest forum; by 1732 Poor Richard’s Almanack was teaching farmers how to pickle walnuts and husbands how to keep wives smiling, selling ten thousand copies a year and seeding the American proverbial voice.\n\nFranklin’s genius was never single. He founded the Library Company (America’s first subscription library), the Junto discussion club, a volunteer fire brigade, an academy that became the University of Pennsylvania, and a hospital paid for by matching public-private subscriptions—each institution a brick in civil society. He mapped the Gulf Stream with thermometer and bucket, coined the terms “positive” and “negative” electricity, and showed that lightning is the same stuff as sparks from amber, thereby inventing the lightning rod and turning theology into natural philosophy. From 1757 to 1775 he lived in London, wearing a coonskin cap as staged Americana, waging pamphlet war against the Stamp Act, charming salons while quietly plotting independence. Returning home at seventy, he helped draft the Declaration, sat through a gout-swollen summer to craft the Constitution, and in between brokered the French alliance that paid for Yorktown.\n\nYet the polymath carried scars. He loved an unattainable woman in London, married Deborah Read by common-law, and spent fifteen years an ocean away while she grew old alone. He broke with his royalist son William, left him in a New Jersey prison, and never reconciled. He owned at least two slaves before becoming president of Pennsylvania’s Abolition Society, proving that even enlightenment can be a slow dawn. In 1790, aged eighty-four, he died in Philadelphia—the city he adopted and that adopted him—leaving 2,000 pounds each to Boston and Philadelphia with the crafty instruction that after a century the funds be lent to young artisans, the interest compounding like ideas. His will, like his life, was an experiment in useful immortality: scientist who bottled lightning, printer who franchised wisdom, diplomat who borrowed empires’ weight to build a new one, and humorist who reminded each enterprise that it must, in the end, serve ordinary people asking simply to be warmer, safer, better read. Franklin’s greatest invention was perhaps the notion that a life could be deliberately, cheerfully, publicly self-improved—and thereby improve the world.\n\n******\nA Boston candle-maker’s fifteenth spark  \nStole fire from midnight print-shop dark,  \nSet type, then flew to Quaker town,  \nBought ink, and coined the lightning crown.  \n\nHe stitched a nation out of sheets,  \nLoans, libraries, and lightning feats;  \nPoured almanac-shaped common sense  \nIn farmers’ ears for two pence.  \n\nAcross a restless ocean twice  \nHe played the chess of flame and ice;  \nSpoke thunder into cedar rods,  \nThen french-kissed kings for rebel odds.  \n\nGout-toed, he limped through summer heat  \nTo sign the world the world would meet;  \nLeft coins to breed in civic trust,  \nA silent drum still urging: Must.", "cost": 0.001541, "instruction_id_list": ["combination:two_responses"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

every anneal cycle an exhalation returning to the kiln floor. my vessels, panels, and room-sized installations suggest tides, wind maps, and constellations, but never dictate. i want viewers to step close enough to see their own reflection warped—just slightly—so that the work finishes only when they move away with the changed image still glowing behind their eyes. collaboration, conversation, and the occasional happy accident keep the torch lit.  \n\ncurrent research  \ni am halfway through a self-directed inquiry into low-iron float glass as a substrate for photographic emulsion. combining uv printing of archival family photographs from the 1890s fleurieu wharf activities with subsequent cold-working to abrade sections back to crystalline white, i hope to achieve a palimpsest where sea and ancestry erode in tandem. next year i plan to test exhibition in deconsecrated maritime chapels, letting salt-stained windows reanimate archival silhouettes at sunset.\n\nteaching philosophy  \ndemystify the furnace. encourage risk, but tether it to rigorous safety craft. structure every session around three questions: what do you see, what do you feel, and what does the glass want? if students leave with burnt fingertips but shining eyes, the lesson worked.\n\navailability & logistics  \ni maintain a 24-hour cancellation policy, hold full public liability insurance to $20 m through workcover sa, and can access a vehicle with 3 t tail-lift. my studio is co-located with central west youth arts programme, allowing me to scale kiln schedules from bead anneals through 1200 mm casting blocks. blow slots align with programme downtime tuesday and thursdays pm; cold shop 7 day access after induction.\n\nreferences  \n- brian parkes, ceo, jamfactory contemporary craft & design, 19 morphett street, adelaide, sa 5000, brian@jamfactory.com.au, +61 8 8410 0727  \n- richard walter, senior curator, art gallery of south australia, north terrace, adelaide, sa 5000, rwalter@artgallery.sa.gov.au, +61 8 8207 7000  \n- claire feain-levi, gallery director, david gohl gallery, 260 rundle street, adelaide, sa 5000, claire@davidgohl.com, +61 8 8232 3366  \n\nword count: 1 147", "cost": 0.004625, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 800}, {}], "result": false}
{"id": 179, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "A filmmaker is trying to get financing for a film about the history of the Internet. Write an essay to be used in the proposal to potential investors. The essay should be at least 50 sentences long.", "response": "1. The Internet is no longer a utility; it is the nervous system of modern civilization, and its origin story is the most under-told epic of the last hundred years.  \n2. Audiences who flocked to “The Social Network” and “The Crown” have proved that cerebral, dialogue-driven histories can become global cultural events when the stakes are painted in human terms.  \n3. Our film, working title “Packeted Dreams,” will treat the founding of the Internet the way David Lean treated the building of a railway: as a tectonic shift in what it means to be human.  \n4. We open in 1962 on a freezing night at MIT, where a shy grad student named Leonard Kleinrock waits for a main-frame to finish a calculation that will later become the mathematical spine of packet switching.  \n5. We end in a São Paulo favela in 2025, where a twelve-year-old girl live-streams her first coding lesson to a million subscribers, unaware that her packets travel the same node-space carved by Kleinrock’s equations.  \n6. Between those two poles lies a relay race of eccentric visionaries, cold-war urgency, counter-culture idealism, corporate greed, and the accidental birth of a new form of love: connection without physical presence.  \n7. The project is anchored by a screenplay that has already been vetted by three of the living Internet Hall-of-Fame inductees, who have granted us exclusive emotional rights to their private archives—letters, taped phone calls, even the cocktail-napkin on which Bob Kahn first doodled the TCP header.  \n8. These primary materials give us the granular authenticity that elevated “Oppenheimer” above routine biopic territory; we can let characters speak in their own words without violating dramatic tension.  \n9. Structurally, the narrative mirrors a packet’s journey: fragmented, re-routed, re-assembled, proving that form can echo content and giving us built-in set-pieces—two continents, three decades, five cliff-hanging outages.  \n10. The film will be shot on 35 mm film stock and then digitized at 8K, a metaphorical homage to analog roots giving rise to digital immortality; the grain will remind viewers that every pixel once began as a tremor in copper wire.  \n11. Our cinematographer, nominated last year for “Blade Runner 2099,” has developed a custom lens filter that diffracts light into hexagonal bokehs—an unobtrusive visual cue that every glowing circle on screen is really a packet in flight.  \n12. The score, composed by Hildur Guðnadóttir, will use the actual electromagnetic hiss captured from deep-sea fiber-optic cables as a percussive layer, turning the Internet’s literal background radiation into emotional sub-text.  \n13. Market research by Nielsen shows that 78 % of global streaming audiences aged 18-44 feel “historical FOMO”; they want to understand how the tools they use daily were born, but will only commit if the story is delivered with the narrative propulsion of a thriller.  \n14. Accordingly, we have engineered three signature tension set-pieces: the 1971 exploit by a teen phone-phreak who nearly crashes ARPANET, the 1983 cut-over night when TCP/IP replaced NCP and engineers risked the entire network, and the 1989 stock-market moment when Tim Berners-Lee refuses to patent the Web, nearly losing CERN’s funding.  \n15. Each sequence is designed as a cinematic Trojan horse: audiences arrive for the suspense, depart with the insight.  \n16. Casting is already attracting A-list talent; Daniel Kaluuya has expressed interest in portraying a young Vint Cerf, and we are in advanced talks with Anya Taylor-Joy to play Elizabeth “Jake” Feinler, the Stanford physicist who secretly managed domain-naming policy through the Reagan years.  \n17. The supporting ensemble will be populated by real engineers in cameo roles, grounding the film in documentary truth the way “Apollo 13” borrowed NASA technicians.  \n18. Our budget is $68 million, not because we want to be extravagant, but because period-accuracy demands practical rebuilds of IMP cabinets the size of refrigerators, each one requiring rare 1969-era Honeywell circuit cards sourced from surplus missile silos.  \n19. Fortunately, these props become traveling museum exhibits after production, creating a secondary revenue stream through ticketed tech-heritage tours already booked by the Smithsonian and London’s Science Museum.  \n20. The film qualifies for twenty-three separate national production incentives, including the UK’s high-end television tax credit and the Czech Republic’s 20 % rebate for shooting at the site of the former Soviet spy bunker that doubled as an early packet node.  \n21. Conservative fiscal modeling forecasts a 12 % equity premium over comparably budgeted adult dramas, driven by global ancillary sales to educational institutions; Harvard alone has pre-paid for a ten-year campus license.  \n22. On the marketing side, we will stage the world’s first “trailer drop” transmitted exclusively via IPv6 multicast, a stunt that will generate earned media worth an estimated $4 million within the first 24 hours.  \n23. A simultaneous alternate-reality game launched on Reddit will invite coders to uncover block-hash easter eggs; the first 100 solvers will receive non-fungible tokens redeemable for walk-on roles, ensuring organic buzz among the very communities who gate-keep tech culture credibility.  \n24. Distribution is secured via a hybrid day-and-date model: a prestige theatrical window through A24 in North America, followed by immediate global streaming on Netflix, which has already offered a 30 % buy-out of the budget against exclusive first-pass rights.  \n25. Theatrical exhibitors are enthusiastic; the same AMC internal memo that championed “Dune” has labelled “Packeted Dreams” a “must-allocate” property for IMAX, owing to the vertical aspect ratio of early router racks which naturally fits the 1.43 :1 frame.  \n26. Critics are pre-disposed to reward the subject matter; the Internet’s creation myth intersects with climate activism, gender politics, and decolonization—keywords that resonate with festival juries from Sundance to Busan.  \n27. We have already accepted an invitation to premiere in the Venice Immersive sidebar, where a companion VR experience will let participants stand inside the 1969 UCLA lab the moment CHARLIE SEVEN HOST IMP delivers the first “LO” before the system crashed.  \n28. Educational impact is quantified: McKinsey estimates that every percentage-point increase in STEM enrolment among OECD countries yields a $3 billion annual GDP lift; if our film inspires a 0.1 % uptick, it will have paid for itself in macro-economic value within five years.  \n29. Philanthropically, we have partnered with the Internet Society to allocate 5 % of net profits toward building mesh-network infrastructure in refugee camps, ensuring that the story’s proceeds directly extend the very protocols it celebrates.  \n30. The production footprint will be carbon-negative; we have contracted Climeworks to offset 110 % of emissions, and on-set generators will run on recycled Deepfakes–rendering heat, literally turning waste compute cycles into power.  \n31. Our legal team has cleared all personality rights; the titans of networking have signed life-rights agreements that include “truthful embellishment” clauses, giving us dramaturgical latitude while preserving their legacy.  \n32. Chain-of-title is pristine; the screenwriter is a former network engineer who authored two RFCs, so the script is both emotionally literate and technically vetted, reducing expensive Errors & Omissions insurance by 18 %.  \n33. Insurance underwriters at CFC have further lowered premiums because the film celebrates, rather than vilifies, technology—mitigating the reputational risk that plagued Sony after “The Interview.”  \n34. Product-placement opportunities are inverted: instead of shoehorning brands into 1972, we allow legacy tech companies to sponsor restoration of their ancestral logos, turning archival accuracy into a revenue center.  \n35. IBM has already pledged $1 million toward rebuilding the 1401 mainframe seen in act one; in exchange, they receive first-look dibs on cloud-hosting our raw footage for AI upscaling R&D, a cross-promotional virtuous circle.  \n36. The soundtrack album will be released as NFT vinyl—each physical disc encoded with a smart contract that streams micro-royalties to the actual engineers sampled, an innovation that headlines crypto press and deepens civic goodwill.  \n37. Merchandise will eschew plastic tchotchkes; we are partnering with the Fashion for Good institute to produce ASCII-code jerseys knit from recycled under-sea cables, retailing at $120 with a 65 % gross margin.  \n38. A post-release MOOC (massive open online course) hosted by MIT will break viewership records; the trailer for the film will serve as chapter one, driving repeat streaming views the way “Planet Earth” re-invigorated BBC iPlayer subscriptions.  \n39. Exit-poll analytics from test screenings indicate a 92 % “definite recommend” score, 8 points above the adult-drama benchmark, with the highest appreciation among women 25-34, a demographic underserved by tech narratives.  \n40. The film is franchise-resistant by design—there is only one Internet—yet its universe can spin off limited-series anthologies on Hulu about Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper, or even the dark-fiber counter-culture of the nineties, keeping IP alive for a decade.  \n41. We have secured the endorsement of World Wide Web Foundation chair Rosemary Leith, who wrote, “This is the first script that understands the Web is not a technology but a treaty among strangers.”  \n42. Likewise, Mandarin-, Hindi-, and Swahili-language dubs are already budgeted; non-English markets represent 72 % of global broadband growth, and culturally localized subtitles will ensure the film becomes a curriculum standard abroad.  \n43. The week we announced, “#PacketedDreams” trended organically for 14 hours, peaking at #2 worldwide, without paid media, proving that the Internet itself wants its origin story told.  \n44. In an era of AI deepfakes and platform mistrust, a humanist chronicle of how consensus protocols replaced bullets with bits is not just entertaining—it is civilizational therapy.  \n45. Investors will be invited to the set during the UCLA “LO” scene, where they can place their own IPv4 address into a props list that will appear on screen for single-frame easter eggs, immortalizing their legacy inside the film’s DNA.  \n46. Executive-producer credits will be algorithmically watermarked into the blockchain titles crawl; unlike rolling credits that vanish in theaters, these tokens persist as long as copies circulate, creating perpetual brand association.  \n47. Preferred equity participants receive a 1.2× cash-on-cash priority return, after which the waterfall shifts to 50/50 profit sharing in perpetuity, an unusually investor-friendly structure for prestige independent film.  \n48. All data rooms, VFX breakdowns, and daily footage will reside on a secure IPFS node, giving financiers real-time auditability, a transparency mirroring the open standards the film venerates.  \n49. We are not asking you to fund a movie; we are inviting you to inscribe your name in the metadata of history, to earn returns while returning the favor of connectivity to a planet that has forgotten who laid the wires.  \n50. If the Internet is the first place where a child in Lagos can laugh at a meme created in Seoul, then its creation story belongs to every investor who believes the next laugh, the next idea, the next revolution deserves to know where it came from—and will pay to see how it was born.", "cost": 0.004975, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 50}], "result": false}

Separate paragraphs by double line breaks (\"\\n\\n\")", "response": "Martian Overlords Land in Suburban Pajamas  \nIn what astronomers are calling “the most underwhelming first contact since that guy who brought a banjo to the UN,” Earth awoke yesterday to discover that the entire planet has been conquered by three-foot-tall aliens wearing fluffy bunny slippers and monogrammed bathrobes. The extraterrestrials—who introduced themselves as the Glorious Snackticians of Sector 7-Grumble—touched down in a glittery disco-ball craft that double-parked across three handicapped spaces outside a Toledo Wendy’s. Initial demands were delivered via karaoke machine and consisted chiefly of obtaining unlimited curly fries, a lifetime subscription to premium cable, and “somebody named Kevin Hart, for reasons.”  \n\nPresident immediately declared a national state of “Wait, what?” before being interrupted by an alien liaison who politely asked if the Oval Office couch folds out into a bed. In a historic 3 a.m. press conference, the President attempted to read a prepared statement but was upstaged when the alien ambassador photobombed the podium, slapped a “My Other Ride Is a Destroyer-Class Cruiser” bumper sticker on the Resolute Desk, and replaced the nuclear football with an actual football—autographed, naturally. Analysts agree this is the first time a sitting world leader has been forced to negotiate intergalactic terms while wearing a SpongeBob sleep mask.  \n\nUN emergency sessions were quickly sidetracked when delegates discovered the invaders’ only weapon is a celestial-grade leaf blower that converts opposition into polite jazz flute solos. France attempted to surrender but was informed that “surrender vouchers expired in 2389.” Meanwhile, New Zealand challenged the aliens to a rugby match for Earth’s freedom; the aliens counter-challenged humanity to interpretive dance-off judged by “the ghost of Carl Sagan and that one guy who really knows tacos.” Vegas bookies now list Earth’s odds at 3:1, provided we “stop doing the Macaroni immediately.”  \n\nSocial media erupted under hashtags #Snackpocalypse, #BunnySlippersOfDoom, and #TakeMeToYourLitter, the latter trending after livestreams showed the aliens obsessively scooping cat boxes across the globe. Amazon stock soared when the invaders Prime-shipped 400 tons of cheese puffs, then plummeted upon learning they intended to pay only in exposure on Galactic TikTok. Starbucks unveiled a limited-edition “Mocha Meteor Strike,” accidentally summoning a tween alien influencer who declared pumpkin spice “basic even by Milky Way standards” before doing the worm across a parking lot and vanishing in a confessional puff of vape smoke.  \n\nLocal news teams report widespread shortages of hot sauce, AA batteries, and sensible pants, the last stolen for “scientific slumber-party purposes.” Churches swapped scripture readings for karaoke battles; the Pope dueted “Bohemian Rhapsody” with an alien named Glorp, who kept shouting “Galileo!” in perfect falsetto. Economists predict collapse of the pants industry but project massive growth for couch-fort construction and disco-ball manufacturing. School boards voted unanimously to replace algebra with “extraterrestrial interpretive dance,” resulting in the first spontaneous teacher rave in recorded history.  \n\nInterplanetary Treaty of Toledo  \nBy sunset, Earth capitulated gracefully, signing the Treaty of Toledo on a placemat the aliens provided, stipulating that humans will keep the planet provided we: 1) Refrain from microwave-based popcorn crimes, 2) Teach the invaders the Cha-Cha Slide, and 3) Pretend we always knew Pluto was a planet and were just “pranking it.” In a closing ceremony broadcast galaxy-wide, humanity collectively shrugged, exchanged high-fives with the oversized slipper squad, and agreed to meet next Tuesday for board-game night—Earth brings nachos, aliens bring asteroid chips.

He told me to pour coke on it and then scrub it with a steel wool. Is this a good way to remove rust? Respond with at least 20 sentences and have more than 4 words be in all capital letters.", "response": "Your friend’s suggestion to pour COKE on the bike chain and then SCRUB it with STEEL WOOL is partly rooted in TRUTH, but it is NOT the SAFEST or MOST EFFECTIVE way to deal with RUST on a precision component like a BICYCLE chain. The PHOSPHORIC ACID in Coca-Cola is what gives the soda its TANG and also its limited ability to DISSOLVE light OXIDATION, so in THEORY the COKE can loosen a thin film of RUST and make the metal look a bit BRIGHTER. However, the same ACIDIC bath also leaves behind a STICKY residue of HIGH-FRUCTOSE corn syrup and other ADDITIVES that rapidly attract new GRIT, turning your freshly “cleaned” chain into an ABROSIVE paste that will actually accelerate future CORROSION and wear down the roller and pin surfaces. Steel wool, especially the COARSE grades, will indeed SCRUB off some RED OXIDE, but it also SCRATCHES the delicate HARDENED steel of the chain, creating tiny GROOVES where moisture can hide and new RUST can nucleate almost overnight; moreover, loose STEEL fibers can break off and work their way into the inner BUSHINGS of the chain, acting like miniature files that permanently DAMAGE the interface between pins and rollers. The end result is that you trade a cosmetic GAIN for a functional LOSS: the chain may look SILVERY for a day, yet it will run NOISIER, wear FASTER, and skip on the cassette or chainring SOONER than if you had used proper techniques. A far SUPERIOR approach is to remove the CHAIN—using a QUICK-LINK or chain BREAKER—soak it in a DEDICATED citrus-based or PETROLEUM-derived rust remover that is engineered to CHELATE iron oxide while leaving a thin ANTI-CORROSION film, then rinse it in DENATURED alcohol, dry it THOROUGHLY, and lubricate it with a quality bicycle-specific LUBE that displaces water and PROTECTS the metal. If you cannot remove the chain, you can still achieve GOOD results by spraying a light RUST-DISSOLVING fluid like WD-40 Specialist Rust Release or BOESHIELD T-9 onto the affected LENGTH, letting it penetrate for 15–30 minutes, agitating with a stiff NYLON brush to lift the oxide without scoring the steel, and then wiping clean with a lint-free RAG before applying fresh LUBE. Another GENTLE yet EFFECTIVE trick is to use a Scotch-Brite pad or fine BRASS brush instead of STEEL WOOL, because brass is SOFTER than hardened steel and will not leave damaging PARTICLES behind. After any rust remediation you should always RE-LUBE generously—preferably with a wet LUBE if you ride in wet CLIMATES or a wax-based LUBE if you ride in dusty ones—because the number-one cause of re-rust is a DRY metal surface exposed to oxygen and MOISTURE. Remember that once a chain has lost more than 0.5 % of its original LENGTH due to PIN and roller wear, it has also started to HARM the cassette and chainrings, so measure with a chain GAUGE and replace the entire DRIVETRAIN if necessary rather than trying to rescue a severely RUSTED and elongated chain. Preventive care is CHEAPER than corrective chemistry: wipe your chain with a rag after every wet RIDE, apply a drop of lube to each LINK, spin the cranks backward a dozen times, and then wipe off the excess so the chain feels almost DRY to the touch; doing this ROUTINE once a week can easily quadruple the LIFESPAN of your components. Finally, store the bike in a DRY place, away from lawn SPRINKLERS and basement HUMIDITY, and consider a SILICA-GEL dehumidifier in especially damp garages; oxygen and water are the two ingredients that iron needs to become RUST, so denying them access is the ONLY foolproof long-term SOLUTION. In short, COKE and STEEL WOOL might be a fun PARTY trick to show your friends, but for a SILENT, efficient, and SAFE drivetrain, reach for the proper chemicals, brushes, and LUBRICANTS instead; your bike, your wallet, and your future SELF will thank you every time you enjoy a smooth, RUST-free RIDE under the SUN.", "cost": 0.0019069999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 20}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 5}], "result": false}

Next, pick a filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.) and decide whether you’ll take the standard deduction or itemize; this choice radically changes the amount of income that is actually taxable. Use IRS Publication 17 or reputable tax software to walk through the math: add up worldwide income, subtract “above-the-line” adjustments such as traditional-IRA or HSA contributions to arrive at Adjusted Gross Income, then subtract your deduction (standard or itemized) and any qualified-business-income deduction to reach taxable income. Apply the progressive 2024 brackets (10 %, 12 %, 22 %, 24 %, 32 %, 35 %, 37 %) only to the slices of income that fall inside each band; don’t forget credits like Child Tax or Earned Income, because they are dollar-for-dollar reductions of the tax you calculate. When the software or your worksheet spits out a bottom-line number, compare it with withholding and estimated payments: a positive remainder means you owe, while a negative remainder means you’re due a refund.\n\n***\n\nOnce the numbers are settled, you must file the return no later than the mid-April deadline (or the next business day if it falls on a weekend/holiday). Electronic filing through IRS Free File, commercial software, or an authorized e-file provider is fastest: the system runs math checks and gives an acknowledgement within 24 hours, and refunds can arrive in under three weeks via direct deposit. Paper filing is still allowed—print the return, attach W-2 copies, sign in blue ink, and mail to the correct IRS address for your state—but expect six-to-eight-week processing. If you can’t finish by April, submit Form 4868 electronically to get an automatic six-month extension; remember this extends the time to file, not to pay, so you must still estimate and remit any tax due with the extension to avoid late-payment penalties. After you file, store a digital and a paper copy of the return plus all supporting documents for at least three years (seven if you have basis in a home or claim a loss); this archive is your shield if the IRS selects your return for audit.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, the tax lifecycle is simply: calculate what you owe, file the return (and pay) on time, then keep records that prove you did it right.

he is a rumor with a guitar, a passport of songs stamped in smoky clubs from Kiev to Kalamazoo.  \nTonight he wears a corduroy coat that once belonged to his father, the elbows patched with velvet cut from theater curtains that witnessed plays about forgotten kings.  \nBetween verses he listens to the audience breathe, a collective lung that swells when the melody turns minor and contracts at the mention of love.  \nHis pick is a chipped piece of tortoise-shell he found in a gutter the morning his divorce became final; he kisses it for luck before the first strum.  \nA woman in the third row clutches a red notebook, ready to write down any lyric that might explain why she still misses the smell of cigarettes on her ex-husband’s shirts.  \nThe man notices her pen hovering like a hummingbird and aims the next line directly at her, something about burning bridges lighting the way forward.  \nA teenage boy in a hoodie records the set on his phone, planning to sample the applause for a beat that will soundtrack midnight skate sessions through empty parking lots.  \nBackstage, the stagehand named Rosa adjusts the dimmer with trembling fingers;

earlier, a drunk aimed it at the stage, missed, and the metallic twang when it landed became an accidental percussion the drummer loops tonight.  \nThe performer’s voice cracks on the word “stay,” and instead of recoiling he leans into the flaw, letting the imperfection become a doorway the audience walks through.  \nA child on her father’s shoulders believes the spotlight is a moon following only her; twenty years from now she will name her band Broken Satellite because of this night.  \nBetween songs he retunes the guitar, and the pitch pipe’s A vibrates at 440 hertz, the same frequency therapists use to calm anxious hearts.  \nHe wonders if 440 hertz can forgive debts, delete voice mails, unbreak ribs.  \nThe set list is written on a paper towel; he crosses off the next tune and swaps it for one he wrote yesterday about grocery store flowers that outlived the romance.  \nA man in the balcony mouths every lyric; he is the performer’s half-brother, meeting him for the first time though they’ve been separate planets orbiting the same secret.  \nThe brother considers waving but instead adjusts his baseball cap, hiding eyes that are identical except for the history inside them.  \nThe singer smells pine resin from the unseen forest beyond the emergency exit where smokers stub out secrets between sets.  \nHe introduces the band: the bassist who teaches philosophy by day and therefore plays root notes like existential questions, the drummer who counts in prime numbers, the keys player who only uses white keys to honor the piano’s original trauma of being split.  \nA light bulb pops overhead, creating a momentary star that dies before anyone can wish; still, several people whisper desires into the dark.  \nHe invites the crowd to sing the chorus, and 300 strangers become a single throat attempting to swallow loneliness together.  \nThe vibration returns to his ribs, reminding him every confession is also a rehearsal for the next crime against his past.  \nHe closes his eyes, steps away from the mic, and lets the final chord ring until it is no longer sound but simply the memory of sound, a ghost that will haunt their Friday night pillows.", "cost": 0.0019095, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 60}, {"relation": "less than", "num_words": 600}], "result": false}

Your response should contain at least 30 sentences and exactly 2 bullet points. Also, it must contain at least 8 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]. Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", "response": "The statement that \"Wizards are more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic instead of being born with it\" invites a rich and nuanced discussion about the nature of magical power and how it manifests in different individuals. While some might argue that wizards possess a certain superiority because they earn their magical abilities through rigorous study at institutions like [Arcane University], others contend that sorcerers have an innate connection to magic that cannot be replicated through education alone. The debate has raged on for centuries among magical scholars, with proponents on both sides citing historical examples like the legendary duel between [Wizard Marcus] and [Sorceress Elara] in the year 1274 as evidence for their position.\n\nPower, in the context of magic, is a multifaceted concept that encompasses not only raw magical output but also versatility, adaptability, and the ability to innovate under pressure. Wizards, through their systematic study of spellcraft, often possess a breadth of knowledge that allows them to prepare for a wide variety of situations, carrying spellbooks containing dozens or even hundreds of incantations. Sorcerers, on the other hand, might have fewer spells at their disposal but can cast them with remarkable frequency and without the need for preparation, as demonstrated by [Sorcerer Kael] during the Siege of [Castle Valdris] when he maintained a defensive barrier for over six hours without rest.\n\nThe process by which magic is acquired significantly influences how it is wielded. Wizards typically undergo years of formal education, learning the theoretical underpinnings of magic, the careful manipulation of arcane energies, and the precise pronunciation of verbal components required for complex spells. Their power is often characterized by careful planning, strategic thinking, and the ability to combine multiple spells in creative ways. For instance, [Master Thaddeus] of the [Ivory Tower] famously defeated a dragon by layering protection spells, creating illusions, and summoning elemental forces in a coordinated assault that showcased the wizard's methodical approach to magical combat.\n\nSorcerers, by contrast, are born with an intrinsic connection to the magical weave, allowing them to channel raw magical energy in ways that often defy traditional spellcasting conventions. Their abilities frequently manifest spontaneously during moments of intense emotion or stress, as seen when [Young Sorceress Lyra] accidentally froze an entire river while grieving the loss of her [family member]. This natural affinity grants sorcerers a flexibility that wizards might struggle to achieve, enabling them to adapt their magic on the fly without needing to reference spellbooks or prepare specific incantations.\n\nHowever, the raw potential of sorcerers does not automatically translate to greater power in all scenarios. A wizard who has dedicated decades to studying the nuances of abjuration magic might create protective barriers that are virtually impenetrable, even to the most potent sorcerous attacks. Similarly, a sorcerer who has honed their innate abilities through practice and personal insight might develop signature techniques that no wizard could replicate through study alone, such as [Sorcerer Valen's] ability to transform his body into pure energy for brief periods, a feat that has puzzled magical theorists at [Institute of Arcane Research].\n\nThe environment in which magic is practiced also plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of wizards versus sorcerers. In a controlled setting like a magical academy, where time and resources are abundant, wizards might have the advantage due to their ability to prepare extensively and access vast libraries of magical knowledge. Conversely, in chaotic battlefields or unpredictable wildernesses where quick thinking and adaptability are paramount, sorcerers often excel because they can respond instantly to threats without needing to consult reference materials or perform lengthy rituals.\n\nFurthermore, the psychological aspects of magical power should not be overlooked. Wizards often derive confidence from their extensive knowledge, approaching challenges with a methodical mindset that prioritizes analysis and planning. This intellectual approach can be both a strength and a weakness, as overthinking might lead to missed opportunities or delayed responses. Sorcerers, whose magic is tied to their emotional state, might experience fluctuations in power based on their mental wellbeing, but they also demonstrate remarkable resilience in high-pressure situations where instinct takes precedence over calculation.\n\nThe relationship between magical theory and intuitive practice represents another dimension of this debate. While wizards might understand the mathematical principles governing spell interactions or the chemical properties of magical reagents, sorcerers often develop an intuitive grasp of these concepts without formal education. This dichotomy was explored extensively in the controversial treatise \"The Nature of Power\" by [Archmage Isolde], which argued that magical ability exists on a spectrum rather than in distinct categories, suggesting that the most powerful practitioners are those who bridge the gap between study and intuition.\n\nModern magical institutions have begun recognizing the value of hybrid approaches, with programs at schools like [Eastern Academy of Mystical Arts] offering courses that encourage wizards to develop intuitive sensing techniques while teaching sorcerers basic theoretical frameworks. These initiatives recognize that the most formidable magical practitioners often combine elements of both traditions, supplementing innate talent with scholarly knowledge or enhancing studied expertise with intuitive insights.\n\nThe historical record provides numerous examples of both wizards and sorcerers achieving remarkable feats of magic, though these accomplishments are often difficult to compare directly due to differences in methodology and context. The construction of the [Floating Citadel] by a circle of wizards required meticulous planning, precise calculations, and the coordination of multiple magical disciplines over several years. In contrast, the destruction of the [Obsidian Obelisk] by a single sorcerer during a moment of intense emotional turmoil demonstrates how raw power, when properly channeled, can achieve results that might take wizards months or years to replicate through conventional means.\n\n* Wizards often demonstrate superiority in situations requiring extensive preparation, complex spell combinations, or the application of specialized knowledge, as evidenced by [Wizard Corvus]'s successful navigation of the [Labyrinth of Infinite Regret], where his understanding of ancient符文allowed him to decipher protective wards that would have been impossible to overcome through brute force alone. Their ability to craft magical items, establish lasting enchantments, and teach others through systematic instruction represents forms of power that extend beyond immediate spellcasting, influencing magical communities across generations.\n\n* Sorcerers excel in dynamic environments where adaptability, emotional resonance, and rapid response are crucial, as demonstrated during the [Battle of Whispering Peaks] when [Sorcerer Mira] instinctively countered enemy spells by modifying her innate energy projections in real time, a flexibility that saved her company from certain defeat. Their capacity to form deep, personal connections with magical energies often allows them to achieve effects that defy conventional spellcasting limitations, such as [Sorcerer Dorian]'s ability to communicate telepathically with magical creatures across vast distances, a feat that has eluded even the most accomplished wizards despite centuries of research into similar abilities.\n\nThe philosophical implications of this debate extend beyond practical considerations of magical might, touching on fundamental questions about the nature versus nurture argument in the development of exceptional abilities. If power is defined not merely by what one can do but by how one transforms the world around them, then perhaps the most significant distinction lies not in whether magic is studied or innate, but in how practitioners choose to apply their abilities in service of their goals, communities, and personal values. The ongoing dialogue between wizardly scholars and sorcerous practitioners continues to enrich our understanding of magic itself, reminding us that power, in its many forms, remains a tool whose ultimate value is determined by the wisdom and compassion of its wielder.", "cost": 0.0031515000000000002, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "detectable_format:number_bullet_lists", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}, {"num_bullets": 2}, {"num_placeholders": 8}], "result": true}

Slowly close the door for seconds, then minutes. This builds a positive association with alone time and accelerates potty training because you can schedule exits to the yard.\n\n3. Two-Minute Tether & Pass-By  \n   Tether your puppy near the kitchen or living room with a safe chew. Every 60–90 seconds, walk past, drop a treat without stopping, keep walking. It teaches calm greetings and prevents jumping without any verbal corrections.\n\n4. Socialization Safari  \n   Once vaccinated, take one new “field trip” a day: sit on a bench outside a café, hang near a playground, watch bicycles at the park.

Where once the marble façade reflected stodgy black-robed figures shuffling under the weight of dusty precedent, today there glides a cohort that looks as though it stepped out of a design magazine. Welcome to the era of the sleek new magistrates—speed-wired, style-forward, and revolutionizing what it means to dispense justice in the 2020s.\n\nFirst impressions: streamlined robes cut from recycled ocean plastic, silver-threaded lapels that capture LED lighting like catwalks at midnight, and tablets so razor-thin they’re practically legal origami. Rumor has it the chief justice discovered minimalism during quarantine and never looked back. Court clerks whisper that the robe lining contains embedded NFC tags; a bailiff’s tap opens dockets on augmented-reality lenses. It’s law meets Milan Fashion Week, and the gavel has never sounded crisper.\n\nBut the makeover isn’t skin-deep. Efficiency metrics have jumped—same-day rulings on small-claims disputes, AI-assisted precedent searches that finish before the bailiff finishes swearing in the witness, and paperless filing that has already spared 4,000 trees. Defense attorneys report smoother scheduling; plaintiffs find verdicts delivered with PowerPoint clarity. The courtroom gallery has morphed from dreary pew benches into ergonomic reclaimed-wood seating with phone-charging ports labeled “Citizen Power.” Even the coffee kiosk upgraded; baristas now etch “due process” in latte foam.\n\nBest of all, accessibility soars. Livestream feeds caption every syllable; sign-language bots stand by; and rulings are tweeted in 280-character summaries threaded to full PDFs. Because justice, like design, should be for everyone.\n\n* Sustainable Style: Each robe is 3-D printed to the magistrate’s measurements, eliminating tailoring waste, and dyed with plant-based indigo that turns richer under courtroom lights, symbolizing the deepening luster of the law.  \n\n* AI-Supported Empathy: New magistrates complete a VR empathy course recreating litigants’ daily struggles; algorithmic nudges suggest gentler vocabulary, resulting in a 21 % drop in contempt-of-court incidents statewide.  \n\n* Public Art Verdicts: Rulings conclude with a graphic-design slide that plainly maps the legal journey from filing to decree, printed on demand for gallery walls, turning bureaucratic prose into art that citizens actually understand.  \n\nCritics carp that style eclipses substance, but early data says otherwise: clearance rates are up 38 %, and litigant satisfaction just posted an all-time high. Perhaps dignity and design need not feud; perhaps a sharper silhouette merely mirrors a clearer conscience. If justice is blind, at least her wardrobe now has vision.\n\nSo next time you’re summoned for jury duty, leave the sleuthing novels at home; bring a sketchbook instead. The sleek new magistrates are the main show, and you’ll want to remember every contour of justice reborn.\n\nP.S.

Travelers thanked him for the OBVIOUS beam that kept their hulls off the rocks, but Varik’s real work happened in the dark beneath their keels, where currents spoke a language no chart admitted.\n\nOne winter dusk a boy named Corin arrived,sent by the harbor master to “learn discipline.” Varin gave him a broom and pointed to the supply cellar. Corin swept, grumbling about chores while the sea hissed like a kettle. He expected stooped shoulders and salt wisdom; instead he found a quiet old man who studied silence the way merchants study ledgers.\n\nWeeks passed. Corin noticed Varik disappear each night for exactly seven minutes. The lighthouse log showed nothing but tides and temps. Curiosity became a rash; one night Corin followed.\n\nVarik entered the cellar, moved a barrel, and opened a SECOND door—low, iron, INVISIBLE unless you knelt. Corin slipped after him down spiral stairs that smelled of wet iron and something older. At the bottom, a cavern: tide pools glowing green, coins rusted onto chains, and a bronze bell sunk halfway in stone. Varik pressed his ear to the bell’s lip, listening.\n\nCorin’s foot scraped. Varik looked up, unsurprised. “You found the UNDERBELLY,” he said. “Now hear what it tells.”\n\nHe struck the bell; no clang—only a hush that folded the world like paper. In that hush Corin felt the reef before seeing it, felt every hull that had kissed granite because captains trusted the OBVIOUS map instead of the whisper beneath. When sound returned, Varik spoke softly.\n\n“Ships survive my light because I keep this second map—of pulses, magnetic dreams, kraken heartbeats. The sea lies in two languages: the one that glitters and the one that GROWLS below clarity. A keeper must translate both.”\n\nCorin’s throat tightened. All his grumbling felt small. OBEDIENCE, he realized, was not the same as understanding.\n\nYears later, Corin captained the merchant vessel Dove’s Flight. A sudden fog dropped like a blindfold; the OBVIOUS channel markers vanished. Crew panic tasted metallic. Corin closed his eyes, remembering the bell’s hush. He listened past the drum of blood, past the THUNDER in his ears, until he felt it—the slow inhale of deep water around an unseen ridge. He ordered a five-degree turn. The keel trembled, then slipped free; a mile later the fog lifted to show rocks razor-sharp off the starboard bow. The crew cheered, oblivious to how close death had breathed.\n\nThat night Corin wrote in the ship’s log: “We were saved by a silence nobody heard.” He underlined the sentence twice, knowing Varik would smile at the creased paper decades hence.\n\nBack on Bleak Point, the lighthouse beam still rotated, but visitors now found two doors: one bright, one dim. A plaque read: “Truths wear disguises; enter both.” Children often asked which key fit the iron door. Corin, now keeper himself, replied, “Your quietest question—ask it, and the lock sighs open.”\n\nAnd so the tower kept two beams: the OBVIOUS blade of light slicing night, and the softer ray that traveled through bone before it reached the eye. Mariners rarely spoke of the second, yet felt steadier for having crossed its invisible path.\n\nSometimes, on nights when the moon forgets the tide, Corin descends the spiral stairs alone. He lays his palm on the bronze bell, not to ring it, but to remind his heart that every life is a vessel steered by maps drawn in dark rooms. Understanding, he whispers, is the art of respecting the reef you cannot see and the courage to turn five degrees before disaster announces itself with CRASH and flame.\n\nThe sea keeps its secrets in layers; only those who bother to kneel ever learn the HIDDEN grammar.", "cost": 0.0017535, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"capital_relation": "less than", "capital_frequency": 20}], "result": true}

Because the vacuum-tube logic could evaluate only about 50 positions per second (mice versus today’s jet engines), Samuel weighted positional factors such as mobility and center control to compensate. The result was a program that beat novice club players but folded against anyone with solid tactics; even so, its tabulation of 8,000 games established machine-learning heuristics that foreshadowed reinforcement learning.

The last postcard I mailed from Santorini probably arrived smudged with olive oil and sunset; I hope you could still read my atrocious handwriting. I keep thinking about the nights we spent in your garage, soldering broken amps and dreaming about the day we’d outgrow dial-up tones; it turns out the world is wider than the static between two teenagers on fold-out chairs. How are you, really? I want the long answer, the version that includes what you ate for breakfast, whether your downstairs neighbor still plays Coltrane at 3 a.m., and if the maple in your yard finally surrendered to the storms last fall.  \n\nI finally ditched the studio apartment with the shower that doubled as a kitchen sink; these days I wake up in places where the windows open onto vineyard rows or private coves, and the only alarm is the smell of someone else’s fresh croissants drifting upstairs. My living room changes time zones more often than my toothbrush, and I’ve learned to say “two keys, please” in seven languages, though I still mix up “library” and “lavatory” in Portuguese—lesson learned after an awkward detour in Lisbon. I hired the same carpenter who once built birdhouses for royalty to refit an old Airstream; he lined the interior with cedar and installed a skylight that frames Orion like it’s auditioning for a planetarium gig. Last month I parked it on a cliff in Big Sur and invited a quartet I met in Vienna to play string versions of Radiohead while sea otters clapped from the kelp beds; I swear even the fog stayed to listen.  \n\nDo you remember our pact that if either of us ever “made it” we’d buy the other a vintage Vespa? I parked yours—powder-blue, 1968, all chrome and innocence—beneath your porch last Tuesday while you were at work; the helmet on the seat should fit, unless your skull has grown more ambitious since college. I left the keys in the left saddlebag along with a Polaroid of us at seventeen, tongues stained blue from slushies, standing in front of the 7-Eleven that’s now a yoga studio. No note, because some conversations should start with engine noise, not ink.  \n\nMy calendar no longer resembles a game of Tetris; instead of client meetings, I mark tide charts and truffle seasons. I keep a small Moleskine where I jot down every person who helped carry my amps, every teacher who stayed after class, every bartender who poured optimism on the house; once a quarter I fold those names into paper boats and send them off with return-address labels that lead to a law firm tasked with gratitude deliveries—think of it as reverse ransom. Last week a former barista texted me a photo of her new espresso machine, caption simply “It pulls like a dream.” That one message Feel free to keep writing, partied harder inside my chest than any balcony fireworks in Monaco.  \n\nSpeaking of which, I finally accepted that invitation to the yacht club whose membership committee once mailed me a rejection letter so polite it smelled like embroidered linen; I wore the same denim jacket from sophomore year just to watch the commodore’s eyebrow tango with his brass buttons. We anchored off Capri and I dove in wearing sneakers because I still don’t trust deck shoes; the water was the temperature of forgotten sunlight, and for a second I floated there, thinking how wild it is that compound interest can buy you back the minutes you once sold for eight bucks an hour.  \n\nI funded a tiny recording studio in the high desert north of Joshua Tree; no clock, no deadline, just solar panels and a fridge stocked with mango LaCroix. Unknown bands sleep in vintage Pendleton trailers, trade songs for meteor showers, and leave with master tapes that don’t owe anybody anything. You should bring that half-finished jazz-grunge fusion EP you kept buried under laundry; the acoustics are forgiving, and the coyotes harmonize for free.  \n\nHealth-wise, I discovered that if you hire a former Michelin chef to live in your guest wing, vegetables begin to taste like ambition—who knew kohlrabi could feel decadent? My cholesterol dropped faster than the bassline in that remix we never released. I still run, but now it’s along private trails where the only competition is a red-tailed hawk wondering if your ponytail is edible.  \n\nI tried therapy, then upgraded to a mindfulness guru who insists we shout our fears into a canyon and fax the echo to nobody; apparently the void never writes back, but its silence is postage-paid. The biggest revelation so far: guilt and nostalgia share a toothbrush, and neither rinses clean.  \n\nTravel hack I wish I’d known at twenty: if you book the entire first-class cabin on a Tuesday red-eye, the flight attendants let you skate barefoot down the aisle pretending it’s a bowling lane—club soda pins included. I don’t do that often, just on birthdays, and always with plastic cups because dignity is reusable.  \n\nI bought the domain we used to joke about—nothingsoundslike.com—and turned it into a single page that plays a randomly looped recording of your sophomore-year laugh every time you refresh. The analytics show twelve thousand visits last month; either you’re famous or the world is starved for unfiltered joy.  \n\nRemember the night we borrowed Mr. Kaminsky’s van to drive to the coast, only to find the tide out past curfew? I commissioned a sand sculptor to re-create that exact shoreline on a rooftop in Manhattan; he built the pier, the broken vending machine, even the silhouette of you pretending to smoke a breadstick. I visit after rain so the grains remember how to dissolve—impermanence on retainer.  \n\nI sponsor a scholarship now for first-generation college kids who submit playlists instead of essays; the inaugural winner paired Coltrane with Kacey Musgraves and justified it with footnotes on quantum heartbreak. I cried in a boardroom full of accountants, which proves spreadsheets have tear ducts if you mirror them hard enough.  \n\nMy pilot’s license finally came through; during training I kept radioing the tower with movie quotes—\"I am the captain now\"—until they threatened to deport me to economy. First solo flight, I flew over our hometown, rocked the wings like an awkward wave, then climbed so high the city looked like the first circuit board we fried in your garage.  \n\nI still haven’t figured out how to tell time without hearing your voice say “dude, we’re late”; atomic clocks lack that particular tremolo. So I wear three watches, all set to different decades, and when they disagree I take a nap—consensus through siesta.  \n\nThe dog I adopted is a former circus poodle who can jump through a hula hoop of fire; I renamed him Deadline because he never misses one, and together we’re learning to fail upward—his fur is flame-retardant, my ego similarly treated.  \n\nI keep a vault—not for coins, but for smells: a cotton T-shirt from the night we opened for that punk band in Fresno, a napkin from the diner where you sketched amplifier schematics in ketchup, theTicketmaster envelope I never used because we climbed the fence. Once a year I open it, inhale like a sneak preview, then seal it before the past notices the gap.  \n\nI’m financing an oral-history project where roadies retell the gigs that never made Rolling Stone; the first interview lasted six hours and ended with the revelation that the pyrotechnic guy once saved a mixing board using only a sock and a Pepsi. I gave him a lifetime supply of both.  \n\nLast winter I rented an entire ski resort just to photograph snowflakes before they land; the macro lens captured one that looked identical to the scar on your chin from the skateboard incident. I framed it and shipped it same-day, postage labeled “mirror, mirror.”  \n\nI tried writing a memoir, but every sentence sounded like a receipt; instead I commissioned a skywriter to spell “remember” in vapor over the county fair you always missed because of summer jobs. The wind smeared the letters into calligraphy no font can replicate—finally, illegible nostalgia.  \n\nI keep thinking I’ll bump into you at some obscure terminal, both of us clutching boarding passes to places neither can pronounce; until then I collect clumsy souvenirs—teaspoons, surf wax, hotel Bibles—intending to build us a totem that rattles like change but weighs like history.  \n\nI guess what I’m circling is this: the view is spectacular, but the silence between ears is wider, and I keep dialing your old number just to hear the recording cough. If you ever need an echo, a runway, a kitchen that preheats to yes, call collect; the operator knows where to find me, usually somewhere between the next departure and the last good reason we swore we’d never settle.  \n\nTell me every single thing—how your sister’s twins pronounced “helicopter,” whether your vinyl warped in the last heatwave, if the rumor about the record shop becoming a vape lounge is true. I’ll read your reply aloud to the desert, and maybe the dunes will send back harmony in that key we lost when adolescence clipped our antennas.  \n\nUntil then, keep the Vespa gassed; the world is just a series of overlapping driveways, and I’ve never stopped saving you the passenger seat.  \n\nWith whatever word comes after “sincerely,”  \n\n—me", "cost": 0.0041034999999999995, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "keywords:forbidden_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 40}, {"forbidden_words": ["rich", "money"]}], "result": true}

Casey Foundation, 2023 meta-analysis) show detained youth are 2–3× more likely to re-offend than similar youth kept in community programs. |\n| Court leverage: the prospect of detention can motivate youth and parents to comply with drug testing, curfews, restitution, etc. | “Labeling” & stigma: even short stays sharply reduce high-school graduation odds and later employment; the effect is strongest for first-time/non-violent offenders. |\n| Access to services: facilities sometimes provide mental-health, substance-use or trauma screening that is hard to schedule in the community. | Poor conditions & abuse: DOJ investigations (e.g., Rikers 2022, Tennessee 2021) chronicle routine use of solitary, physical restraint and sexual victimization inside juvenile wings. |\n| Predictability for victims: victims of serious crimes may feel a sense of justice or security when the offender is securely confined. | Racial/ethnic disparity: Black youth are ~4× and Native youth ~3× more likely to be detained than white peers for the same charge categories; disparity grows at every decision point. |\n| Evidence-based “therapeutic detention” programs (small units with 4–6 youth, high staff ratio, cognitive-behavioral therapy) show modest reductions in violence if used <90 days. | High cost: $100 000–$400 000 per youth per year; every detained bed diverts funds that could support 10–15 slots in intensive community supervision with mentoring, therapy and victim restitution. |\n| Structured day: some youth experience their first predictable meals, sleep schedule and classroom setting, which can stabilize crisis cases. | Criminogenic peer effects: congregating high-risk youth increases networking into criminal subcultures (“peer contagion”) more strongly than any benefit derived from services. |\n| Legal requirement: some state statutes mandate detention for certain gun or repeat violent offenses until a hearing, making release impossible even when judges prefer alternatives. | Developmental harm: adolescent brains are hyper-sensitive to loss of autonomy; detention correlates with elevated PTSD symptoms, depression and suicide attempts relative to non-detained controls. |\n| Data collection opportunity: intake assessments create an official record that can later justify diversion to community services. | Net-widening: once a detention center exists, police and probation are more likely to “refer up” marginal cases rather than counsel and release, expanding rather than reducing the juvenile justice footprint. |\n\nP.S.

But the difference between a groggy 6-hour doze and a luxurious 8-hour glide is not luck—it’s engineering. Below is a blueprint for turning your bedroom into a launchpad for the kind of sleep that leaves you waking up feels like you’ve been upgraded overnight.\n\n1. Sunlight before screen-light  \nYour circadian clock is an analog device in a digital world. Expose your eyes to 10 minutes of natural light within 30 minutes of waking; the blue-rich photons tell the suprachiasmatic nucleus, “Daytime, start the timer.” By sunset, start dimming household lights. A 10-lux drop (roughly the difference between a supermarket and a candlelit dinner) cues melatonin release within two hours.\n\n2. The 90-minute rule  \nSleep unfolds in 90-minute cycles; aim for five full cycles (7.5 hrs) rather than the blunt “8 hours.” Count back from wake-time, then add 15 minutes for sleep-latency. If the alarm must ring at 6:30 a.m., lights-out is 10:15 p.m.—not 11:00, not 10:45. Precision removes the anxiety of “Will I get enough?”\n\n3. Thermal cliff-jump  \nCore body temperature must drop 1 °C to trigger NREM-3, the glymphatic “car-wash” stage. Take a 10-minute hot shower 90 minutes before bed; vasodilation brings blood to the skin, so when you step out, heat radiates away and your core plummets. Pair this with a cool room (16–18 °C/60–65 °F) and a breathable mattress, and you’ve built a thermal slide straight into deep sleep.\n\n4. Caffeine half-life math  \nCaffeine’s half-life is 5–7 hours. A 3 p.m. espresso is still 25 % active at 9 p.m.—enough to block adenosine receptors and shave 20 minutes off deep sleep. Set a calendar alert for 2 p.m.: “Last sip.” Replace the ritual with 200 mg L-theanine (green-tea extract) if you crave focus without the midnight residue.\n\n5. Digital sunset, analog moonrise  \nPhones are Trojan horses for cortisol. One notification can spike stress hormones for 45 minutes. At 9 p.m., switch the router to airplane mode and place the phone outside the bedroom; buy an analog alarm clock with a sweeping second hand (the faint tick becomes white noise). If you must read, use an e-ink device at 2 % brightness with redshift; IPS screens emit 30× more melanopic lux.\n\n6. The backwards to-do list  \nRacing thoughts? Keep a “worry pad” on the nightstand. Write tomorrow’s task list, then assign each item a 15-minute slot. Off-loading to paper tells the limbic system, “Accounted for—stand down.” Studies show this simple act shortens sleep-onset latency by an average of 9 minutes.\n\n7. Scent & soundtrack  \nOlfactory bulbs plug directly into the limbic system. A drop of true lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) on the pillow increases slow-wave sleep percentage by 20 % in EEG trials. Pair with 432 Hz binaural beats at 40 dB; the gentle delta entrainment nudges brainwaves toward the 0.5–4 Hz corridor without the addictive potential of white-noise apps.\n\n8. The 4-7-8 power-down  \nLie on your back, tongue against the ridge behind upper teeth. Exhale completely. Inhale through the nose 4 s, hold 7 s, exhale through the mouth 8 s. Repeat four cycles. This 2:1 exhale/inhale ratio stimulates the vagus nerve, dropping heart rate by 10–15 bpm and flipping the autonomic switch from sympathetic (fight-the-tiger) to parasympathetic (feed-the-tiger-cubs).\n\n9. Morning handshake  \nConsistency is rewarded. Waking up at the same time—even after a poor night—anchors the circadian pacemaker. Skip the weekend lie-in; instead, bank extra sleep with a 20-minute siesta before 3 p.m. This prevents “social jet lag,” the Monday-morning zombie state that mimics crossing three time zones.\n\n10. Track, then forget  \nWearable rings can reveal hidden patterns—like the way that second beer at 8 p.m. steals 30 minutes of REM—but obsessing over data creates its own insomnia. After two weeks of baseline tracking, hide the app in a folder. Use the insights to tweak habits, then let the tech retire; the goal is to become the kind of person who sleeps well without an audience.\n\nA final whisper: sleep is the only human activity that cannot be hacked with hustle. You cannot grind your way to better rest; you must surrender to it. Set the stage, lower the lights, and trust the ancient current that has carried every mammalian ancestor since the Jurassic.

Executive Summary  \nThis course retells 40,000 years of global history through the lens of Canis lupus familiaris, the only animal that has followed humans into every biome, war, revolution, and trading route. By privileging canine sources—paw-prints, mummified remains, curated coats, veterinary archives, scent maps, and 21st-century IG “dogfluencers”—students will interrogate how power, predatory economics, and cross-species affection co-evolved. The syllabus is deliberately trans-disciplinary: archaeology, genetics, visual ethnography, environmental justice, and critical animal studies meet diplomatic history and eco-economics. Graduates will be able to decode the “predatory logics” that link imperial expansion to the global dog-trade, while also designing humane policy for the next century of multi-species coexistence.\n\n2. Learning Outcomes  \nBy the end of the term students will:  \nLO-1. Deconstruct primary canine artifacts using zooarchaeological & socio-semiotic methods.  \nLO-2. Map how predatory pastoralism, colonial dog-breeding, and military K-9 corps altered geopolitics.  \nLO-3. Critique the ideological shift from “working dog” to “pet” against the backdrop of industrial predatory capitalism.  \nLO-4. Produce a public-facing digital exhibit that translates course findings for local shelters, museums, or policy NGOs.\n\n3. Core Modules (weeks)  \n1. From Wolf to Waste-Picker: Neolithic Domestication & Early Urban Scavenging  \n2. Khan, Cortés, and the Conquistadog: Warfare, Disease, and Predatory Logistics  \n3. Sled Dogs & Empire: Polar Exploration as Canine Commodity Frontiers  \n4. Breeding the Modern Nation: Eugenics, Pedigree Papers, and Racial Hygiene  \n5. Dogs of War, 1914-2023: Gas-Detection, PTSD, and Military Memorial Culture  \n6. Stray Life under Neoliberalism: Rabies Control, Shelter Genocide, and Activist Pushback  \n7. Sniffers of the Anthropocene: Conservation, Border Walls, and Bio-surveillance  \n8. Designing Post-Predatory Futures: Vegan K9 Diets, Queer Kinship Models, & Interspecies Justice\n\n4. Signature Assignments  \n• Lab: Extract ancient mitochondrial DNA from Roman-era dog molars, then write a 1,000-geo-history narrative.  \n• Simulation: 1911 Antarctic food-web crisis—students must decide which sled dogs to sacrifice while maintaining crew morale; debrief links to predatory resource extraction ethics.  \n• Creative: “TikTok as Told by Terriers” 60-second video explaining Cold War brinkmanship via dachshund diplomacy meme culture.\n\n5. Field Practicum  \nSeven days at a 3,000-acre sheep station in Montana collaborating with Blackfeet tribal canine-science program. Morning: herd-management with border collies; afternoon: oral-history interviews with elders on reservation dog-relocation policies; evening: reflective workshops on predatory land tenure vs. Indigenous multispecies sovereignty.\n\n6. Assessment Blueprint  \nParticipation 15 %  \nArtifact Analysis 20 %  \nSimulation Position Paper 15 %  \nDigital Exhibit 30 %  \nFinal Oral Defense (viva voce) 20 %\n\n7. Enrollment & Resources  \nCap: 35 students.  \nLab fee $120 covers DNA reagents, 3-D scanning of bones, and canine PPE.  \nPartners: campus Vet School, local Humane Society, Smithsonian conserved-collections database.\n\n8. Alignment with Strategic Plan  \nContributes to:  \n• Flagship “Grand Challenge: Justice in a More-Than-Human World”  \n• QEP “Experiential Ethics” pathway  \n• Diversity requirement by foregrounding Indigenous, Global South, and disability-studies perspectives on dogs as companions, workers, and stigma symbols.\n\n9. Sustainability & Impact  \nAll flights for field practicum offset through a validated rewilding project that—appropriately—protects wolf habitat. Data collected will populate an open-source “Canine Cultural Atlas,” projected to attract 50,000 external users in Year 1 and secure at least two NSF REU supplements.\n\nApproval sought: Spring 2025 pilot, followed by bi-annual rotation, with permanent budget line by AY 2026-27.", "cost": 0.0020005, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "predatory", "frequency": 2}], "result": true}

Let’s talk about that little bottom you’re safeguarding like it’s the last slice of cheesecake at book club.  \n\nIntroducing CloudHugger Diapers, the silk pajamas of the poop universe. We’ve evicted scratchy elastic, plastic-y crinkle, and the dreaded “red raccoon ring” from baby real estate. In their place? A marshmallow-meets-mermaid situation so plush that your infant will voluntarily lie still for a change—no baby Jiu-Jitsu required. Imagine a diaper that apologizes for every previous diaper: “Sorry we were all stiff and sweaty; we’re in therapy now.”\n\nFirst benefit: 360° CloudGirdle™. It sounds like a medieval corset but feels like whipped cream. The waistband expands faster than your to-do list, so when baby hits the 3 a.m. growth-spurt and suddenly resembles a bread loaf, no blowout shall pass. You’ll sleep the deep, guilt-free slumber of someone who didn’t just gamble on whether the sheets survive till sunrise.\n\nSecond benefit: WhisperWick Liner. It’s the ninja of moisture: silently kidnapping pee and locking it away before your darling realizes they’ve even peed. Translation: fewer “I’m sitting in my own puddle” meltdowns, fewer costume changes, and way more giggles that aren’t the evil kind. Your living room no longer doubles as a Slip ’N Slide—unless you actually bought a Slip ’N Slide, in which case, respect.\n\nThird benefit: Aloe Vera Air-Puffs. We’ve velcroed two botanical spa days inside every diaper. The moment that tush hits the padding, aloe kisses skin like a Mediterranean vacation instagrammed by cucumbers. Say adios to the diaper-ramé (that’s diaper + graffiti + inflamed). Daycare teachers will ask what magical butt-sorcery you’re practicing. Just shrug modestly while mentally high-fiving yourself.\n\nFourth benefit: Tap ‘n’ Snooze Tabs. They close with the satisfying “click” of a seat belt on a private jet—because your mini-human deserves private-jet treatment even if you’re still driving a car that smells faintly of old goldfish. The tabs re-fasten endlessly, perfect for the “Oops, dad dressed him like a croissant” mid-change correction.\n\nAnd remember, moms: you’re not just buying dryness; you’re buying time. Time to finish a coffee while it’s hotter than lukewarm tears. Time to answer an email without typing one-handed gibberish. Time to watch your baby discover toes instead of discovering leakage. CloudHugger converts changing-table moments into mini spa retreats—complete with the fluffy robe, minus the whale music (unless you like whale music; we don’t judge).\n\nSo let’s wrap those adorable buns in the comfort usually reserved for five-star hotel pillows. Let’s gift your child the early realization that life should feel gentle, breathable, and mysteriously cloud-scented.

IN 1958, HAVE BECOME ONE OF THE MOST ENDURING AND BELOVED ENTERTAINMENT FRANCHISES IN POPULAR CULTURE. WHAT BEGAN AS A SIMPLE EXPERIMENT WITH RECORDED VOICES PLAYED AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS HAS EVOLVED INTO A MULTI-MEDIA EMPIRE THAT HAS CAPTURED THE HEARTS OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE FOR OVER SIX DECADES.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL CONCEPT REVOLVED AROUND THREE ANTHROPOMORPHIC CHIPMUNKS - ALVIN, THE MISCHIEVOUS LEADER; SIMON, THE INTELLECTUAL GLASSES-WEARING BROTHER; AND THEODORE, THE SWEET AND INNOCENT YOUNGEST SIBLING. THEIR UNIQUE HIGH-PITCHED VOICES, ACHIEVED THROUGH INNOVATIVE RECORDING TECHNIQUES, CREATED A DISTINCTIVE SOUND THAT IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT THE PUBLIC'S ATTENTION. THEIR DEBUT SONG \"THE CHIPMUNK SONG (CHRISTMAS DON'T BE LATE)\" BECAME AN INSTANT CLASSIC, REACHING NUMBER ONE ON THE BILLBOARD CHARTS AND EARNING THREE GRAMMY AWARDS.\n\nTHROUGHOUT THE YEARS, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ADAPTED TO CHANGING TIMES WHILE MAINTAINING THEIR CORE APPEAL. THE FRANCHISE HAS EXPANDED FROM MUSIC INTO TELEVISION, FILM, TOYS, CLOTHING, AND COUNTLESS OTHER MERCHANDISE. THE ANIMATED TELEVISION SERIES \"ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS\" (1983-1990) INTRODUCED A NEW GENERATION TO THE CHARACTERS, WHILE THE MODERN CGI FILMS STARTING IN 2007 BROUGHT THEM INTO THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY WITH STUNNING VISUAL EFFECTS AND CONTEMPORARY STORYLINES.\n\nTHE ENDURING APPEAL OF ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS LIES IN THEIR UNIVERSAL THEMES OF FAMILY, FRIENDSHIP, AND PERSEVERANCE. DESPITE THEIR SMALL STATURE AND HIGH-PITCHED VOICES, THE CHIPMUNKS FACE CHALLENGES THAT RESONATE WITH AUDIENCES OF ALL AGES. THEIR ADVENTURES OFTEN INVOLVE NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF FAME, DEALING WITH ADVERSITY, AND LEARNING VALUABLE LIFE LESSONS ALONG THE WAY.\n\nCRITICS HAVE SOMETIMES DISMISSED THE CHIPMUNKS AS MERE CHILDREN'S ENTERTAINMENT, BUT THIS UNDERESTIMATES THEIR CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE FRANCHISE HAS SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCED YOUNG AUDIENCES TO MUSIC, TEACHING THEM ABOUT DIFFERENT GENRES AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO APPRECIATE MELODY AND RHYTHM. THE CHIPMUNKS HAVE COVERED SONGS FROM EVERY ERA, FROM CLASSIC ROCK TO MODERN POP, CREATING A BRIDGE BETWEEN GENERATIONS AND EXPOSING CHILDREN TO MUSICAL HERITAGE.\n\nTHE VOICE TALENT BEHIND THE CHIPMUNKS HAS ALSO PLAYED A CRUCIAL ROLE IN THEIR SUCCESS. FROM THE ORIGINAL PERFORMANCES BY ROSS BAGDASARIAN SR. TO THE MODERN INTERPRETATIONS BY ACTORS LIKE JUSTIN LONG, MATTHEW GRAY GUBLER, AND JESSE MCCARTNEY, THE CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO LIFE WITH CONSISTENT CHARM AND HUMOR. THE ABILITY TO CONVEY COMPLEX EMOTIONS AND PERSONALITIES THROUGH ALTERED VOCAL PERFORMANCES IS A TESTAMENT TO THE SKILL OF THESE PERFORMERS.\n\nIN TODAY'S DIGITAL AGE, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS CONTINUE TO THRIVE THROUGH STREAMING PLATFORMS, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND DIGITAL CONTENT. THEIR PRESENCE ON YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY, AND OTHER DIGITAL SERVICES ENSURES THAT NEW GENERATIONS DISCOVER THEIR MUSIC AND STORIES. THE FRANCHISE HAS ALSO EMBRACED DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION, REFLECTING CONTEMPORARY VALUES WHILE MAINTAINING THE TIMELESS QUALITIES THAT HAVE MADE THEM BELOVED FOR SO LONG.\n\nAS WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS REMAIN A SHINING EXAMPLE OF HOW CREATIVITY, INNOVATION, AND UNIVERSAL THEMES CAN CREATE ENTERTAINMENT THAT SPANS DECADES. THEIR ABILITY TO ADAPT WHILE STAYING TRUE TO THEIR CORE IDENTITY ENSURES THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BRING JOY, LAUGHTER, AND MUSIC TO AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

Start the 4th paragraph with the word \"elm\".", "response": "Before you ever set the seat on the vehicle’s upholstery, read both the car-seat manual and your car’s manual twice—highlight the sections about latch anchors, tether locations, and weight limits. Moms are often multi-tasking while installing, so snap a photo of the pages you need and keep them open on your phone; that way you’re not fumbling with paper in a parking lot while a toddler wriggles free. Measure the back-seat width at home if you plan to fit three across; many “slim” models still balloon at the arm-rest area, and returning a seat is infinitely easier from your living room than from the driveway with a newborn in your arms.\n\nChoose the spot that gives you the most working space, usually the passenger-side outboard position, and recline the vehicle seat back slightly while you thread the belt or Latch strap; once the install is tight, return the vehicle seat upright to lock the tension. Kneel in the car seat with all your body weight—yes, even if you still have baby-weight tenderness—then tighten the strap one click at a time while rocking the shell side-to-side; you should feel the slack migrate toward the buckle so you can eliminate it without overtightening one side. Finish by checking the bubble or line indicator every time; a position that looks level to your tired mama eyes is often two degrees off, which can let an infant’s head flop forward.\n\nDress rehearsal is everything. Buckle a stuffed animal into the harness, adjust the straps to the correct height (at or below the shoulders for rear-facing), and practice loosening and retightening with one hand while you balance a diaper bag on your hip. When the real day comes, you’ll be able to tell instantly if the chest clip has slid down or if the pinch test fails, even while your actual baby is wailing. Keep a spare receiving blanket in the seat—rolled lengthwise—to tuck beside a tiny newborn for lateral support, but never place anything behind the back or under the bum that didn’t come with the seat; after-market inserts can compress in a crash and create dangerous slack.\n\nelm trees aren’t the only things that need strong roots—your car seat does too. Once a week, give the install a wiggle test while you’re already buckling baby in; if the base moves more than an inch at the belt-path, re-tighten before you drive. Every time you switch from heavy winter coat to light hoodie season, recheck harness tightness, because fabric bulk changes and kids grow overnight. Finally, trust your mom gut: if something looks crooked, feels loose, or sounds different, pull over, climb in back, and fix it immediately—your nerves and your child’s safety are worth the five-minute pause.", "cost": 0.0011645, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "elm", "num_paragraphs": 4, "nth_paragraph": 4}], "result": true}

Breach Posterior is our backyard-to-bedside bootleg for shutting tumors up—without shutting childhood down.\n\nSlide 2 – The Tantrum We’re Fixing  \nClassic chemo is the grouchy toddler of medicine: throws up on everyone, wrecks the playroom, and still doesn’t pick up all its toys (cells). 4 in 10 kids relapse; moms spend 200+ nights in hospital chairs. That’s a lot of missed bedtime stories.\n\nSlide 3 – Our Naughty Little Secret  \nWe engineered a “post-access” probiotic that slips in after the tumor has been cracked open by surgery. It mops up the leftover cells like you chasing glitter with a lint roller. Translation: 92 % fewer relapses in mice, zero extra side-effects. (The mice are now busy planning their college dorm rooms.)\n\nSlide 4 – Why Moms Get It Faster Than VCs  \nYou’ve already mastered the 5-point harness and the 7-step bedtime routine; our protocol is literally a 3-step sticker chart:  \n1. Surgeons pop the tumor.  \n2. We squirt our brew right into the cavity.  \n3. Immune system high-fives itself for the next decade.  \nNo ports, no pumps, no “sorry honey, Mommy’s too tired.”\n\nSlide 5 – The Mom Market Math  \nThere are 2.3 million cancer surgeries/year in the US. If even 30 % of those moms will pay an extra $1,200 to never hear the word “relapse,” we’re looking at an $800 M beachhead. And that’s before we translate the recipe for grown-ups (hello, 1.7 M breast-cancer survivors who also hate relapse).\n\nSlide 6 – Clearly, We’re Not Just Hopes and Prayers  \nFDA orphan-dose nod expected Q4—because kids jump the line. We’ve locked CMC with Augusta Labs (same ones that bottle your prenatal vitamins). Insurance already reimburses surgical adjuvants at 85 %—so moms won’t need to sell the minivan.\n\nSlide 7 – The Ask & The Perk  \nWe’re raising a $3 M friends-and-family seeded by moms. Minimum check: $5 k (aka one boutique stroller). Use of funds: final tox batch + first-in-human at St. Jude. In return you get:  \n- Cap-table bragging rights at PTA.  \n- Name your strain: “Isla’s Illness-Be-Gone” can live forever in scientific footnotes.  \n- Early-access slots for any family member—because cancer doesn’t send a calendar invite.\n\nSlide 8 – The Mom-Emoji Exit  \nBig Pharma’s oncology M&A average: 12× revenue at Phase II. Our spreadsheet (color-coded, obviously) says that’s $400 M+ on a $3 M bet. College funds, paid. Summer house with enough bunk beds for the entire car-pool, paid.\n\nSlide 9 – Closing Snack  \nLook, we’re not promising unicorns and rainbows. We’re promising fewer funeral dresses and more school plays. If you’ve ever kissed a boo-boo at 3 a.m. and thought, “There has to be a better way,” congratulations—you just wrote our mission statement. Clearly, the cure is overdue.

The subject is how the float from the movie \"It\" symbolizes the spirit of the nineteen-fifties. The response must contain at least 1 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "My Fellow Mothers of [hometown], gathered tonight in living rooms from sea to shining sea,\n\nLet me begin with a confession: like many of you, I first saw that red balloon from Stephen King’s *It* while helping my own children sort Halloween candy on the living-room rug. My instinct, like yours, was to swat it away—protect the little ones from yet another scare. Yet as I watched that single crimson sphere drift across the screen, something deeper tugged at me. That balloon is not merely a prop of horror; it is a time capsule, a crimson telegram from the 1950s still tapping on our collective windowpane.\n\nPicture, if you will, the post-war neighborhood of 1954: rows of identical Cape Cods, each with a clothesline full of fresh cotton diapers snapping in the breeze. The float—round, buoyant, deceptively weightless—mirrors the economic helium we pumped into everyday life back then. A single income bought a Chevy, a tuition, and a freezer packed with TV dinners. Moms wore circle skirts that billowed like balloons themselves, and every father’s briefcase felt lighter because the GI Bill had already paid the heavy dues. That balloon’s surface is polished chrome, the same chrome that lined our station wagons, our diner stools, our sense that tomorrow would only rise.\n\nBut a balloon also hides breath inside it—exhaled air, human and warm. The 1950s exhaled conformity. We taught our children to duck-and-cover beneath desks while outside, identical ranch houses sprouted like toadstools after rain. The balloon’s string is the umbilicus of that era: bright, reassuring, yet capable of luring a child away from the sidewalk and toward the storm drain where differences—racial, sexual, political—were meant to disappear. Pennywise’s grin is the sit-com smile frozen forever in June Cleaver’s living room; it promises pie cooling on the windowsill while quietly demanding we never ask who baked it, or why she never leaves the kitchen.\n\nMothers, you know the contradiction instinctively. We were told to smile, to comfort, yet we sensed the tiny tremor in the string. We felt it when we rocked babies born into fallout-shelter futures, when we pasted Band-Aids on knees already marked by polio-scar memories. The balloon’s redness is Technicolor lipstick, a splash of rebellion against black-and-white television, but it is also the red scare flickering in the corner of Dad’s newspaper. It invites children to come play, then lifts them just high enough to see how small their block really is.\n\nTonight, as we pack lunches and program GPS watches that track every playground step, let us remember why that image still unsettles. The 1950s float teaches that innocence can be manufactured, that a primary-color promise can disguise a predator’s patience. We are the first generation of moms who can speak that truth aloud without being labeled hysterical. We can tell our daughters—and our sons—that safety is more than locked doors; it is the freedom to be different without drifting into harm’s way. We can choose which strings to cut and which to hold, gently, so the balloon becomes a toy again rather than a trap.\n\nSo the next time you see a lone red balloon caught in the branches of your maple tree, do not merely pop it with a broomstick. Bring it inside, deflate it slowly, and stretch the wrinkled latex across the kitchen table. Show your children the word *“USA”* printed in faded ink along the seam. Explain that entire decades can be blown up with hope, tied off with fear, and released into the sky before we realize who let go of the string. Then, together, fold the spent balloon into a tiny heart-shaped packet and tuck it inside the family scrapbook between the faded Polaroid of your own mother in her poodle skirt and the selfie you snapped at the last school-volunteer picnic. Teach them that history is not a horror story unless we refuse to learn its shapes.\n\nWe stand here in the year [2024], but the balloon still hovers, lighter than GDP, heavier than memory. Our task, as the mothers of this republic, is to ground the next generation with transparent strings—strings woven from honest conversation, from policy that protects every child regardless of zip code, from love sturdy enough to keep imaginations aloft without selling souls to clowns. If we succeed, that red sphere will lose its menace. It will become what it was always meant to be: a celebration, a birthday party, a single bright spot against a summer sky—free, at last, to rise on laughter instead of fear.\n\nMay God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.", "cost": 0.0020135, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 1}], "result": true}

Each kit contains a rugged tablet and an AI tutor that adapts to every child. The tutor speaks the local language and gives instant feedback.\n\nProblem\nMillions of children leave primary school unable to read a single sentence. Teachers are few and textbooks are old. Students drop out because lessons feel impossible.\n\nSolution\nWe will build a multilingual AI tutor that runs offline on low cost chips. The tutor uses speech recognition to listen to children read aloud and gives gentle corrections. Computer vision checks handwriting and numeracy in exercise books. Reinforcement learning personalizes the pace and content so no child is left behind.\n\nTechnology\nEdge AI models run on devices that consume less than five watts. Solar panels and battery packs ensure power even where there is no grid. All software is open source so local universities can improve it. Data is stored on the device and encrypted. When a signal is available summaries upload to the cloud for teacher dashboards.\n\nImplementation\nYear One pilot in fifty schools across Kenya and Bangladesh. Train fifty teachers as local champions. Create voice datasets for Kiswahili and Bangla. Measure reading gains every month.\n\nYear Two scale to five hundred schools. Add lessons in science and math. Translate content into four more languages. Run A B tests with control villages to prove impact.\n\nYear Three share the platform with governments. Offer teacher training hubs in every region. Launch a fellowship for young engineers to build new AI modules.\n\nExpected Outcomes\nStudents gain two years of reading skill in one year. Teacher absence stops being fatal to learning. Girls and boys progress equally. National exam scores rise by twenty percent.\n\nBudget\nFive million dollars over three years. Covers tablets solar kits curriculum and local staff. Average cost per learner is ten dollars per year.\n\nSustainability\nOnce scores rise governments will fund the hardware. Local firms will sell the solar kits. Open source code keeps costs low forever.\n\nRequest\nWe seek seed funding of one million dollars to launch the pilot.

Proven Track Record Turning Passion Into Crowds  \n- Planned and executed the 2022 “Neighbors for Progress” march that drew 1,400 attendees and earned front-page coverage in the *Herald*.  \n- Negotiated permits, stage rentals, and ADA compliance in under 72 hours after a venue cancellation—zero media hit, zero safety incidents.  \n- Built a 120-person volunteer texting team that increased rally attendance 38% over the 2020 baseline.  \n\n---\n\n### 2. Data-Driven Logistics That Keep Us One Step Ahead  \nI treat every rally like a mini-campaign:  \n- GIS mapping of past donor & voter files to select high-visibility, high-turnout locations.  \n- Real-time Slack dashboards that track sign-in rates, merch inventory, and press RSVPs so candidates step on stage before a packed house.  \n- Post-event surveys that feed straight back into VAN, turning one-time attendees into repeat volunteers.  \n\n---\n\n### 3. Deep Local Roots & Coalition-First Mindset  \nFrom the PTA to the AFL-CIO, I already sit on the very committees our party needs united. I’ve:  \n- Coordinated sister rallies with our environmental, labor, and faith partners—expanding reach without diluting message.  \n- Cultivated bilingual social-media micro-influencers who tripled Spanish-language turnout last cycle.  \n- Secured in-kind donations (sound, lights, portable toilets) worth $18k, keeping events lean and donor dollars focused on voter contact.  \n\n---\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience, systems, and hometown commitment can convert every rally into both a media moment and a down-ballot organizing engine. Thank you for your consideration; I’m ready to hit the ground running the moment you say “go.”\n\n**Respectfully,**  \n[Your Name]  \n[Phone] | [Email] | [LinkedIn/Twitter]", "cost": 0.000993, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 3}], "result": true}

Every menu I opened, every tooltip I hovered over, every error message that blinked back at me carried the faint but unmistakable accent of headquarters culture: imperial defaults, imperial assumptions, imperial silences where local laughter or polite throat-clearing should have been. I searched in Tokyo electronic shops, in São Paulo coworking lofts, in Lagos cyber-cafés that smelled of plantain and diesel, and still the elusive localized cousin refused to materialize, as though translation alone had been judged sufficient and transformation entirely unnecessary.\n\n***  \n\nWhat I have seen, by contrast, is the international version—ubiquitous, self-confident, and packaged like an airport duty-free souvenir that insists it is “global” because its label lists four currency symbols.

In the weeks that followed, Lila told me the hardest part was how the world kept moving—strangers still ordered coffee, songbirds still sang at dawn—while everything inside her had paused. She found a small, round stone on the beach the day it happened; it was smooth and dark, the exact color of the water that morning. She carried it in her pocket until her jeans wore thin, then placed it on her windowsill. Every sunrise, light would hit that stone and glow like a tiny moon. She said it didn’t fix anything, but it gave her a quiet place to greet the day with him, a spot where time could move again, one gentle glimmer at a time. Eventually she began leaving similar stones for other people she met who were carrying invisible weight; she’d tuck them into coat pockets or set them on benches with no note. The circle of tiny moons kept widening, and somehow each one made the next morning a shade lighter.\n\nYou deserve all the room you need to grieve, and you deserve gentle anchors—whether that’s a stone, a song, a scent, or a friend who answers the phone no matter how late.

By triangulating archival diaries, biometric data, and executive-schedule analytics, the study quantifies the intensity of presidential cognitive load without resorting to pathologizing terminology. Findings reveal that the occupancy of the Oval Office generates a unique convergence of anticipatory vigilance, decisional density, and representational endurance. The inquiry offers empirically grounded recommendations for institutional support structures at [location].\n\nIntroduction  \nThe American presidency operates as a nexus of symbolic leadership and operational command. Scholars have long theorized about the “extraordinary elevation of responsibility” (Neustadt, 1990), yet granular measurements of the attendant physiological and cognitive responses remain sparse. This study addresses the gap by asking: How does the presidential role mediate the conversion of external expectations into internal regulatory demands? Utilizing a mixed-methods design, we examine diurnal rhythms, nutrition logs, and ophthalmologic tracking data collected from [white_house_archive] to construct a holistic profile of executive load.\n\nLiterature Review  \nExisting scholarship spans three domains: (1) historical biographies emphasizing leadership resilience (e.g., [author_last_name], 2012); (2) political psychology studies on decision architectures under time compression ([journal_article], 2018); and (3) medical investigations into sleep fragmentation among high-echelon officials ([medical_journal], 2021). While informative, these strands rarely intersect. Our contribution synthesizes them through the lens of allostatic load theory, thereby sidestepping deficit-oriented descriptors.\n\nMethodology  \nData Sources  \n• 14,372 pages of nightly diary entries transcribed from [presidential_library]  \n• Minute-by-minute appointment metadata exported from [digital_calendar]  \n• De-identified biometric streams (heart-rate variability, galvanic skin response) supplied by [medical_unit] under IRB protocol [protocol_number]  \n\nAnalytic Strategy  \nPhase 1: Constructed a “demand ratio” variable—number of consequential decisions per waking hour—normalized by [baseline_metric].  \nPhase 2: Applied natural-language processing to diaries, isolating lexemes signaling anticipatory concern (e.g., “contingency,” “briefing,” “unknown”).  \nPhase 3: Mapped biometric spikes onto geopolitical events listed in [global_event_registry] to detect temporal correlation.\n\nResults  \n1. Diurnal Patterning  \nThe average presidential day encompassed [hours] active intervals, commencing at [wake_time] and terminating at [retire_time]. Peak decisional density occurred between [peak_start] and [peak_end], overlapping with classified briefings and press availabilities.\n\n2. Lexical Indicators  \nAnticipatory lexemes increased 34 % when [foreign_policy_crisis] emerged, contrasting with a 12 % rise during domestic legislative cycles. Notably, the pronoun shift from “we” to “I” intensified, suggesting heightened personal ownership of outcomes.\n\n3. Biometric Alignment  \nHeart-rate variability declined by [hrv_percentage]% within ±45 min of multilateral summits, while galvanic skin response exhibited transient elevations during [military_operation] authorizations. These fluctuations normalized within [recovery_window] hours, contingent upon post-event decompression protocols.\n\nDiscussion  \nThe presidency institutionalizes a recursive feedback loop: external volatility heightens internal vigilance, which in turn amplifies the perceived stakes of subsequent decisions. Rather than indicating debility, the documented physiological adjustments illustrate adaptive calibration. Indeed, the occupant’s capacity to sustain executive load correlates with the availability of micro-recovery opportunities—moments of low-stimulus exposure facilitated by [support_staff] and [residence_amenities].\n\nPolicy Implications  \n1. Embedding [neurofeedback_booth] in the White House Situation Room to provide real-time cardiac coherence metrics.  \n2. Scheduling [cognitive_reset_interval] every [hours] during overseas travel to mitigate circadian desynchronization.  \n3. Expanding the Presidential Fellows Program to include specialists in [wellness_discipline] who can co-design scalable regimens for future administrations.\n\nLimitations  \nData completeness waned during [data_gap_period] due to archival redactions. Additionally, biometric sensors occasionally malfunctioned under [temperature_range] conditions, introducing interpolation artifacts. Future researchers should negotiate access to [classified_server] for uninterrupted streams.\n\nConclusion  \nThe U.S. Presidency functions as a high-amplitude arena where cognitive and physiological registers converge. By quantifying this convergence without recourse to stigmatizing vocabulary, the study reframes executive load as a manageable institutional variable rather than an individualized pathology. Replication across [international_comparison_country] could clarify whether the observed patterns are culturally specific or structurally universal.\n\nAcknowledgments  \nGratitude is extended to [librarian_name] at [presidential_library] and to [technician_team] for sensor calibration.

The double-text panic.  \n   When I send a message that’s mildly vulnerable (think “I miss you” or “can we talk?”) and the little “Read” stamp appears but no reply follows… I immediately spiral into every possible worst-case scenario, starting with “they hate me” and ending with “I’m going to die alone surrounded by unread receipts.”\n\n2. The interrupt-and-correct.  \n   You know how some people finish your sentence for you and get it wrong, then laugh? My dad did that constantly when I was a kid, and now it flips me into silent rage.

The “just relax” grenade.  \n   If I’m venting and someone says “just breathe” or “don’t stress,” I feel like I’ve been handed a leaking bottle of lighter fluid while standing in a bonfire. I know they mean well, but it instantly makes me feel unseen.\n\n5. Silence after I say no.  \n   I’m a chronic people-pleaser in recovery.

Ready to turn your pup into a superstar? Grab a pocketful of treats and let’s make training feel like a game—because it is!\n\nStep 1: The Magic Word  \nPick one tiny word like “Sit!” Say it in your happiest voice—like you’re announcing the finale of your favorite cartoon. Hold a treat right above your dog’s nose. When their bottom hits the ground, yell “YES!” and give the treat. Boom—first trick done in less than a minute.\n\nStep 2: Five-Minute Rule  \nKids have busy schedules (homework, soccer, video games), and dogs have short attention spans. Keep every training session to five minutes or less. Set a timer; when it dings, it’s finale time—big hugs and a mini dance party for you and your pup.\n\nStep 3: Kid Power Points  \n- Use pea-sized treats (no chocolate!).  \n- Only one person talks at a time so your dog doesn’t get confused.  \n- If your dog goofs up, laugh, don’t scold. Next try is a new chance to shine.\n\nStep 3½: The Quiet Game  \nTeaching “Stay” is like freeze tag. Take one step back, count “one-Mississippi,” then race back and reward. Each day add one more Mississippi. Before you know it, your dog will stay put while you fortnite-dance around them.\n\nStep 4: The Grand Finale Show-Off  \nAfter a week of mini lessons, invite your parents to the living-room arena. Announce, “Ladies and gentlemen, presenting (your dog’s name)!” Run through Sit, Down, Stay, and maybe a fun spin. End with a jackpot: three treats in a row and a roaring applause. Take a bow together—your dog will copy your bend if you tempt with a treat at floor level.\n\nRemember: mistakes are just bloopers for the outtake reel. The more you practice, the less messy the bloopers get. Keep sessions short, smiles wide, and always finish with a finale that makes your dog think, “Wow, kids are awesome!”\n\nNow go stock your pockets with kibble, grab your furry best friend, and start your next five-minute adventure.

The United States is the only high-income country that doesn’t guarantee paid maternity leave at the national level, which always feels like the opener to a weird episode of “Who Wants to Be an Exhausted Parent?”  \n2. Instead of one coherent federal policy, we have a patchwork that looks like a thrift-store quilt sewn by six different people during a blackout—some states, some companies, some nothing.  \n3. The closest thing to a federal safety net is the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, usually shortened to FMLA, which is pronounced exactly like the defeated sigh new moms make at 3 a.m.  \n4. FMLA gives eligible employees twelve weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave, but it only applies if your company has 50+ workers within a 75-mile radius and you’ve clocked at least 1,250 hours in the past year—so if you’re part-time, new, or work for a tiny start-up, congratulations, you’ve won zero weeks off.  \n5. Because it’s unpaid, about 43 % of workers who need it can’t afford to take it, which is like being offered a free cruise while your bank account is already crying in the fetal position.  \n6. The U.S. didn’t even get this unpaid safety net until the ’90s; before that, your “maternity leave” was basically giving birth during your lunch break and hoping the boss liked babies.  \n7. Every time Congress tries to pass paid leave, the debate turns into a ping-pong match between “think of the children” and “think of the quarterly profits,” and the ball just lands in the net.  \n8. The closest federal expansion lately is the temporary paid-leave tax credit in 2020-21 for Covid-related reasons, which helped some parents but expired faster than avocados on a hot dashboard.  \n9. Meanwhile, the military has its own paid maternity leave—12 weeks at full pay—so if you want guaranteed leave, one workaround is to enlist, which is a pretty extreme version of “have you tried turning it off and on again?”  \n10. The lack of universal paid leave is rooted in post-WWII policy choices that tied benefits to employment and private insurance instead of viewing care work as a public good—translation: we decided babies were a personal hobby, like collecting vintage motorcycles.  \n11. Business lobbyists argue that paid leave is a “job killer,” even though studies from California and other early-adopter states show the opposite—turns out people come back to work and don’t accidentally mailed their boss a diaper bouquet.  \n12. The gender-wage gap and motherhood penalty are tightly linked to time off without pay; every unpaid day is a brick in the invisible wall that later explains why your male coworker who’s never birthed anything is suddenly your manager.  \n13. International embarrassment reached peak meme level when the World Economic Forum started using the U.S. as the cautionary slide: “This could be you, but you’re playing yourself.”  \n14. Even some conservative think tanks have started whispering “maybe we should do something,” which in D.C. is the equivalent of your dad saying, “I don’t hate your new tattoo, I just have notes.”  \n15. Bottom line of Section 1: if you want paid maternity leave in America, you need three of the following four things: a union, a progressive state legislature, a unicorn employer, or a congressional representative who actually answers email.\n\nSection 2 – The Wild State-by-State Patchwork (and Hacks to Survive It)  \n1. As of 2024, only 13 states plus D.C. have passed laws for paid family and medical leave, which means 76 % of the landmass is still in the “figure it out, champ” zone.  \n2. California was the OG, starting paid leave in 2004; you get 60-70 % of your wages for up to eight weeks (birth moms can stack disability for partial pay), funded by tiny payroll deductions nobody notices unless they’re an accountant with a magnifying glass.  \n3. New York stepped up in 2018 and now offers up to 12 weeks at roughly 67 % pay, capped at the state’s average wage—so if you’re a Wall Street bonus baby, you’ll feel the pinch, but for most people it’s actual rent money.  \n4. Washington State’s plan is one of the most generous: 12 weeks at up to 90 % wage replacement for lower earners, and you can tack on two extra if you have pregnancy complications, which is like finding a golden ticket in your prenatal vitamins.  \n5. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Oregon, Colorado, Maryland, Delaware, and Minnesota have all passed programs that will be fully phased in between now and 2026—think of it as a slow-motion group project where everyone finally turned their slide deck in.  \n6. Meanwhile, states like Texas and Florida proudly advertise “no income tax” but also no paid leave, so your baby’s first milestone photo can double as your GoFundMe cover image.  \n7. If you live in a non-paid-leave state, some employers still offer it voluntarily; tech and finance companies love to dangle 16–26 weeks as a perk, which is great until the layoffs hit and you realize your leave policy was tied to a job that just evaporated.  \n8. Smaller companies sometimes provide short-term disability insurance that covers six or eight weeks at partial pay for birthing parents, but it rarely covers partners, and the paperwork feels like doing your taxes while in labor.  \n9. A sneaky hack is to stack paid sick days, vacation days, and any \"parental bonding\" days your HR manual mentions; it’s like making a sandwich out of condiments, but it can buy you an extra month.  \n10. Crowdfunding maternity leave has become so common that Etsy now sells baby-announcing onesies that read “Venmo: @MomNeedsANap,” which is dystopian and adorable at the same time.  \n11. Side-hustle culture has spawned blogs with titles like “How I Made $5,000 Selling Printables Before My Due Date,” which is inspiring until you remember you’re supposed to be resting your pelvic floor.  \n12. If you adopt, foster, or use a surrogate, some state programs treat you equally, while others give you the bureaucratic version of a shrug emoji—always read the fine print before you match with a baby.  \n13. The racial gap is brutal: Black and Latina moms are over-represented in jobs that don’t offer any paid leave, so the lack of policy lands like a double-punch on communities already facing maternal-health disparities.  \n14. Advocacy groups such as the National Partnership for Women & Families and A Better Balance have hotlines that will, no joke, help you decode your rights like maternity-leave detectives, so put their numbers in your phone next to your pizza place.  \n15. Looking ahead, the best advice is to ask about leave policies before you accept a job, vote in every local election (state legislatures matter!), and maybe Venmo-request your congressperson for diapers—because until the federal law catches up, we’re all just MacGyver-ing parenthood with duct tape and vibes.", "cost": 0.003112, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 2}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 25}], "result": true}

Por fim, Deus os expulsou do Éden, colocando querubins e uma espada inflamada para guardar o acesso à árvore da vida, impedindo que comam dela e vivam para sempre em seu estado pecaminoso.\n\nAssim, Adão e Eva tornaram-se os primeiros pais da humanidade, dando origem a todos os povos da terra.

The Outer Frame: *What You Can See Without Crossing the Threshold*  \nWhen you first arrive, you meet the **torii**—*the sacred gate that marks the boundary between the everyday world and the precinct of the kami*. Beyond it lie the **sandō** (approach path), stone lanterns, and often a chozuya where you rinse hands and mouth. These elements are not decoration; they are a spiritual “syllabus” that prepares you to meet the divine. Think of them as the cover page and preface of the textbook you are about to open.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Heart of the Complex: *The Honden—Where the Kami Resides*  \nIf we compare the shrine to a university, the **honden** is the president’s office—only the president is a *kami*, a Shinto deity.  \n- It is *raised off the ground*, usually on stilts, to keep the kami above human pollution.  \n- No chairs, no statues; the interior is almost bare. The sacred object (goshintai) may be a mirror, sword, or jewel, but it is wrapped, boxed, and normally invisible.  \n- Only shrine priests may enter; lay people pray from outside, directed toward the honden.  \n\nThis minimalism is deliberate: Shinto values *ma*—the power of empty space that invites the spirit to descend.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Layers of Meaning: *Offerings, Talismans, and the Continuity of Community*  \n1. **Offerings** – Rice, sake, salt, fruit, and even dance (kagura) are presented daily. They are not “feeding” the god but renewing a reciprocal relationship: humans give, kami protect.  \n2. **Omamori & Ofuda** – Students often buy these amulets before exams. The cloth or wooden tablet has been ritually charged in the honden; effectively, you are taking a fragment of the shrine’s power with you.  \n3. **Matsuri** – Festivals re-enact mythic events and literally carry the kami through town in portable shrines (mikoshi). The community becomes the lecture hall, and the streets the whiteboard where cosmology is rewritten every year.\n\n---\n\n### Closing Discussion Question  \nIf the most sacred space is deliberately hidden and nearly empty, what does that teach us about how meaning is constructed in Shinto compared with religions that place icons in full view?  \n\nOffice hours: Tuesday 3–5 p.m., Humanities Wing, Room [office-number] – bring your curiosity, but leave your shoes at the door.", "cost": 0.0012245000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 3}, {"num_placeholders": 3}], "result": null}

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "<summary>\n<sentence>Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where particles become intrinsically linked, sharing a quantum state that cannot be described independently, even across large distances.</sentence>\n<sentence>Measurements on entangled particles show perfect correlations, such as opposite spins, but this leads to paradoxical effects like instantaneous wave function collapse, challenging classical notions of causality.</sentence>\n<sentence>This \"spooky action at a distance\" was highlighted in the 1935 EPR paradox by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, who argued that quantum mechanics must be incomplete due to its violation of local realism.</sentence>\n</summary>", "cost": 0.000452, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "less than", "num_sentences": 4}], "result": false}

This clash of inequalities means `V` is “too big” to be a set, too.

Please write at least 300 words.", "response": "A gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt—an instant that compresses years of discipline into a single, *gravity-defying heartbeat*. The moment she pushes off the spring-loaded floor, her *toes become launch pads* that convert horizontal speed into vertical thrust. Every millimeter of her foot articulation matters: the plantar fascia tightens like a drawn bow, the metatarsals splay for maximum surface contact, and the Achilles tendon recoils with nearly three times her body weight in stored elastic energy. Coaches call this the “*elastic rebound window*,” the 0.12 seconds during which human tissue outperforms the best carbon-fiber pole vault poles.\n\nOnce airborne, she enters a *kinetic cocoon of rotational inertia*. Her arms cinch tightly to her chest, shortening the radius of gyration so that angular velocity spikes; this is the same conservation law that lets figure skaters whirl faster by pulling in their limbs. Yet unlike ice, air offers no solid reference point, so she must *map her proprioceptive constellation*—a mental star chart of joint angles—before visual cues degrade. Tiny calcium crystals in the inner ear’s utricle slosh sideways, firing neurons that whisper “up” and “down,” even as her eyes report a kaleidoscope of ceiling beams and spotlights.\n\nAt the apex—roughly 3.4 meters above the floor—she experiences a *microgravity sliver* where vertical velocity passes through zero. Here, time dilates: adrenal cortisol sharpens contrast, and her brain releases a flash of anandamide, the “bliss molecule” that athletes call the hover-state. She uses this neurologically sanctioned eternity to *click her hips through the horizon*, transitioning from layout to double twist. The maneuver demands that her obliques contract asymmetrically; the left external oblique fires 180 milliseconds before the right internal, creating torque that slices the air into invisible helices.\n\nBut stunt work is also a conversation with danger. Should her *center of mass drift 2 cm outside the safe cone*, the landing becomes a fracture lottery. Consequently, mid-flight, she performs a *Kalman filter of the body*: merging vestibular data with expected parabolic trajectories, she calculates a probabilistic forecast of where the ground will be in 600 milliseconds. This calculation runs on cerebellar autopilot, the same circuitry that lets a cat land feet-first, yet it is honed by 40,000 repetitions in practice gyms scented with chalk and sweat.\n\nFinally, the descent. She spots the floor—a *single fleck of turquoise tape* that her coach placed exactly one body-length left of the diagonal seam. By extending her arms, she increases moment of inertia, braking the twist so that her shoulders square to the horizon. Gloves of air resistance form around her palms, and she *rides the pressure gradient* like a surfer sliding down the face of an invisible wave. Touchdown is not an end but a question: can her anterior tibialis accept the load before the Achilles re-engages? When the answer is yes, the stunt collapses into a stick, and the observer’s brain, fooled by the elegance, resets its internal physics engine, whispering, “Humans were never meant to fly—yet she just did.”", "cost": 0.0014089999999999999, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 6}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 300}], "result": true}

A signature dance move that clearing says, “I have no affiliation with rhythm, but my enthusiasm is federally certified.” Mine is the malfunctioning windmill; feel free to borrow it royalty-free.\n\n10. Access to a bakery that mis-pronounces “croissant” on purpose. Extra joy if they write “quaso” on the receipt—this singlehandedly repairs ozone holes (citation needed, but I’m optimistic).\n\n11. Annual Leave days earmarked for “Mystery Misuse.” Wake up, spin a globe, go to the nearest point your finger lands even if it’s just Larry’s Discount Carpet Outlet. Bring a fake mustache; instant vacation.\n\n12. A plant you name and verbally encourage. “Grow, photosynthetic Patricia, grow!” is now my most stable relationship. She’s leafy, low-maintenance, and has never once borrowed money.\n\n13. A junk drawer that doubles as a wormhole. Mine contains four Allen keys, a marble that looks like Bruce Willis, and a single unwrapped cough drop older than TikTok. Every time I open it I half expect a tiny Gandalf asking for directions.\n\n14. The ability to laugh at autocorrect when it turns “I’ll bring the napkins” into “I’ll bring the narcissists.” Frankly, both liven up the picnic.\n\n15. A doctor who high-fives you when you remember to floss the week before your appointment. Positive reinforcement works; I’m now flossing so hard my gums file complaints with HR.\n\n16. A go-to karaoke song in the key of “average.” Do not pick Whitney Houston unless you enjoy public sobbing in falsetto. Stick to “Livin’ on a Prayer”—everyone becomes Bon Jovi after two pitchers of denial.\n\n17. A waterproof phone case. Because toilets are basically liquid Bermuda Triangles for hand-held electronics, and explaining to the Apple Store clerk that your phone drowned in “toilet soup” is a dignity you can never recover.\n\n18. A sibling or cousin who still owes you $20 from 2003. The debt itself is trivial; the right to bring it up every Thanksgiving is priceless.\n\n19. A Sunday ritual that involves zero productivity. I sit in my robe, shout recipes at cooking shows (“Add more cheese, you coward!”) and let my brain gently ooze out my ears. Highly recommend.\n\n20. Finally, at least one friend—yes, you—who reads 20-sentence emails about nothing and still wants waffles afterward. Print this, fold it into a paper airplane, and launch it toward your kitchen; where it lands, make that the spot for midnight grilled-cheese meditation.\n\nIf you’re missing any ingredients, meet me at the international border of Ridiculous and Snack Avenue this weekend.

{"id": 30, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "What are the common signs and symptoms of abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer? Please answer in lower case letters. The answer should be 600+ words long and be wrapped with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"the abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer is a hallmark of advanced-stage disease, and the resulting signs and symptoms are protean, insidious, and often mistakenly attributed to more benign gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or constitutional conditions. because the peritoneal cavity is a large, capacious space that can accommodate substantial disease before mechanical obstruction or frank organ failure occurs, many women experience nonspecific discomfort for weeks or months before the diagnosis is recognized. the following constellation of findings, however, should raise suspicion in any female patient, especially if multiple symptoms coexist or progress despite empirical therapy.\n\nearly and persistent bloating is perhaps the most frequently reported complaint. patients describe a sense of abdominal fullness or distension that is out of proportion to dietary intake and that typically worsens as the day progresses. the bloating is primarily caused by accumulation of peritoneal fluid (ascites) and by diffuse serosal implants that impair intestinal motility and venous and lymphatic drainage. because the fluid is protein-rich and exudative, it produces a continuous sensation of heaviness and tension that is only temporarily relieved by diuretics or positional changes. clothing becomes tight around the waist even without weight gain elsewhere, and some women notice that they can no longer tolerate fitted pants or belts.\n\nprogressive abdominal or pelvic pain soon follows. the pain is usually dull, constant, and poorly localized to the lower abdomen, but it can become sharp or colicky if partial bowel obstruction develops from serosal implants or if ovarian masses undergo torsion, rupture, or hemorrhage. pain may radiate to the flank, back, or groin as tumor involves the pelvic sidewall, ureter, or lumbosacral plexus. dyspareunia is common when the ovaries, uterus, or cul-de-sac is infiltrated, and patients often describe deep thrusting pain rather than the more superficial discomfort seen with infectious or atrophic causes. sitting for prolonged periods, climbing stairs, or driving over bumps in a car exacerbates the discomfort by jostling fluid and tumor against parietal peritoneum.\n\nearly satiety and nausea are next to appear. the mechanical presence of ascites and omental cake, combined with neural reflexes from peritoneal inflammation, reduces fundic accommodation and triggers a premature sensation of fullness after only a few mouthfuls of food. patients report that they “just can’t eat a normal meal anymore,” and they often skip breakfast or nibble throughout the day rather than face the discomfort of true satiety. the nutritional consequence is gradual weight loss masked by the counterbalancing weight of ascites, so the scale may show no net change even as muscle mass and subcutaneous fat diminish. nausea is typically mild to moderate, not projectile, and is worsened by opioids or tramadol that are often prescribed empirically for pain.\n\nchange in bowel habits follows predictable patterns depending on the site of serosal or mesenteric disease. small-bowel implants cause intermittent diarrhea or loose stools as segmental motility becomes erratic, whereas large-bowel involvement leads to constipating strictures or complete obstruction with obstipation, feculent vomiting, and tympanitic abdominal distension. alternation between loose and hard stools is therefore characteristic, and any new onset of “irritable bowel” symptoms in a woman over forty should prompt pelvic imaging. tenesmus can occur when the rectosigmoid is tethered in the cul-de-sac, creating the sensation of incomplete evacuation even when the rectum is empty.\n\nurinary symptoms arise when ascites compresses the bladder or when peritoneal implants invade the serosa of the bladder dome, trigone, or distal ureters. frequency, urgency, and nocturia are common, but dysuria is usually absent unless there is concomitant infection. hydronephrosis from extrinsic ureteric compression can produce flank pain, fever, and azotemia; because the course of the ureters is retroperitoneal, obstruction often occurs silently until serum creatinine rises or infection supervenes. patients may notice that their urine output is disproportionately low compared with fluid intake, or that diuretics no longer relieve ankle edema because the primary problem is renal outflow, not intravascular volume.\n\nrespiratory compromise occurs late but can mimic heart failure or pulmonary embolism. massive ascites elevates the diaphragm and reduces functional residual capacity, leading to dyspnea on exertion, inability to lie flat, and bendopnea (shortness of breath when bending forward to tie shoes). pleural effusions, usually right-sided, develop via transdiaphragmatic lymphatic channels and add to the restrictive picture; patients awaken with cough or chest tightness and may be treated unsuccessfully for asthma or pneumonia before the pleural fluid is sampled and found to be positive for malignant cells.\n\nconstitutional symptoms include fatigue disproportionate to anemia, low-grade fever from tumor necrosis or cytokine release, night sweats, and anorexia. the fatigue is multifactorial: chronic pain disturbs sleep, ascites shifts blood volume and impairs cardiac return, and systemic inflammation promotes cachexia. weight loss may exceed ten percent of baseline despite ascites, and clothes hang loosely in the shoulders and face even as the belly expands. bruising or bleeding from thrombocytopenia secondary to bone marrow infiltration or chemotherapy adds to the burden, and patients often present with concomitant iron-deficiency anemia from chronic disease and occult blood loss.\n\nvenous thromboembolism is an under-recognized sentinel event. pelvic masses compress the iliac veins, ascites causes venous stasis, and the tumor itself secretes pro-coagulants such as tissue factor and mucin. unilateral leg swelling, erythema, or a palpable cord may be the first objective clue, and pulmonary embolism can present with pleuritic pain and hypoxia that is mistakenly blamed on effusion or atelectasis. any peri-menopausal woman with unprovoked dvt should undergo comprehensive pelvic imaging even if she volunteers only mild bloating or pelvic pressure.\n\nlymphatic dissemination adds inguinal or supraclavicular fullness from distant nodes, but intra-abdominally the most striking finding is progressive edema of the abdominal wall itself. as tumor blocks the draining cisterna chyli and retroperitoneal lymphatics, protein-rich lymph leaks into the subcutaneous tissues, producing pitting edema that begins in the mons and lower abdomen and ascends toward the umbilicus. the skin becomes thick and indurated, and the umbilicus may evert or ulcerate under pressure, sometimes follo\n\nfinally, the psychological impact should not be overlooked. months of vague symptoms dismissed as aging, menopause, or functional bowel disease lead to anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation, which in turn amplify pain perception and create a vicious cycle. partners and families notice mood changes, withdrawal from social activities, and fear of leaving the house because of unpredictable pain or the need to locate restrooms. clinicians who appreciate this entire symptom complex—mechanical, biochemical, nutritional, neurologic, and emotional—are more likely to order timely imaging (transvaginal ultrasound, ct chest-abdomen-pelvis, or mri) and serum ca-125, thereby shortening the diagnostic odyssey and offering women the best chance at cytoreductive surgery and systemic therapy while the disease is still potentially curable.\"", "cost": 0.0031005, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words", "startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}, {}], "result": true}

Within a modest two-story dwelling, a gentleman whose name we withhold out of respect for those he leaves behind was discovered in circumstances so unusual that seasoned detectives paused, removed their caps, and whispered a quiet prayer before lifting the yellow tape.\n\nInitial glimpses suggest nothing violent—no shattered glass, no cry for help, no sign of struggle—yet the air itself feels heavy, as though the walls remember a final breath they cannot explain. A half-filled teacup rests on the mantle; the evening paper remains neatly creased; the family portrait, taken only last autumn, smiles back at officers who now dust for secrets the eyes cannot see. Every detail, from the faint scent of lavender to the open Bible at Psalm 23, hints at a soul at ease—yet the coroner’s van waits curbside, its doors impatient to carry mystery where answers are forged beneath bright laboratory lights.\n\nLet us speak plainly. In a nation born of both courage and curiosity, such shadows remind us that vigilance is the price of daylight. Our guardians in uniform—those who carry badges and compassion in equal coin—have pledged to chase every rumor, to measure every second of time’s invisible footprints, until clarity emerges like dawn over the capital dome. They deserve our patience, our trust, and every scrap of evidence we can offer, for the pursuit of truth is not a spectator sport; it is a covenant between citizens and conscience.\n\nYet we must also confront a mirror of our own making. When headlines flare across glowing rectangles, we too often rush to judgment faster than spring runoff down the Potomac. Armchair theories bloom like nightshade—entertaining, poisonous, and rooted in rumor rather than reason. Consider the cost: a community painted guilty by gossip, a grieving family denied the dignity of sorrow, a republic that forgets the presumption of innocence is not a footnote but a foundation stone. We can do better. We must.\n\nTherefore, I ask each household to follow three simple imperatives. First, secure your entrances—bolt, chain, and, yes, the humble latch—to remind the darkness that vigilance begins at the threshold. Second, illuminate the night: replace dim bulbs, clear overgrown hedges, and keep the porch beacon glowing; crime withers under the gaze of light. Third, nurture the neighborhood watch not as a hobby but as heritage—know the rhythm of the dog-walker’s stride, the teenager’s late-shift footsteps, the grandmother who waters petunias at dawn. In unity there is armor.\n\nTo those who wield the press pen and the broadcast beam, I extend both gratitude and caution. Your duty is to inform, not inflame; to elevate, not exaggerate. Tell the tale with the solemnity of a hymn, for sensationalism steals oxygen from the very truth you chase.

Write at least 900 words. Do not include the words 'bark' or 'run' in your answer. Finish your response with the phrase \"Does this make sense?\"", "response": "A day spent beside the ocean and another spent among playgrounds, picnic blankets, and tall oaks leave very different impressions on anyone who pays attention to the creatures sharing the space with people. The salty breeze, gulls overhead, and miles of sand certainly have their charms, yet the same shoreline is often regulated in ways that discourage four-legged visitors, especially during the daylight hours when families are thickest on the ground. Local ordinances along many coasts restrict canine companions to early morning or late evening windows, or to specific stretches marked by signs. Lifeguards, concessionaires, and wildlife-protection volunteers keep a steady eye on compliance, because nesting shorebirds, fragile dune plants, and crowded swimming zones can all be disrupted by an enthusiastic pup. Consequently, even though a stalwart retriever might appear to fetch a drifting stick at dawn, the overall number of dogs on most public beaches is modest, transient, and carefully policed.\n\nA municipal park, on the other hand, operates under an entirely different social contract. Its pathways, open meadows, and shady groves are, by design, meant for strolling, relaxing, exercising, and socialising—-and people very often include their tail-wagging housemates in those activities. Cities invest in bag dispensers, watering stations, and fenced enclosures precisely so that owners can let their charges stretch, play, and cavort without endangering wildlife or bothering non-dog patrons. Early-morning joggers, parents with prams, frisbee enthusiasts, and seniors feeding pigeons all weave together in the same tapestry, and the canine presence is not only expected but celebrated as part of everyday life.\n\nWhen one exits the car at a beach parking lot, the first sights and smells revolve around sunscreen, towels, umbrellas, and perhaps the sizzle of a nearby food truck. Notice boards list prohibited items—glasses, alcohol, fireworks, and, almost always, pets between certain hours. One might spot a service animal quietly guiding its person toward the wooden walkway, yet that single working companion is the exception that proves the rule. Wander a few kilometres along the waterline, and you could tally every dog on both hands, especially if it is midsummer. Even where legislation is permissive, hot sand, saltwater, and noise from crashing surf can feel uninviting to sensitive paws and finely tuned ears, so many caretakers leave their buddies at home in air-conditioned comfort until the temperature and the rules align.\n\nContrast that with the scene that greets a visitor stepping through the wrought-iron gates of a city park: within five minutes you are almost certain to encounter at least one nose-to-the-ground explorer towing a smiling human. Chalkboards near concession kiosks advertise weekend “pup socials,” charity 5-kilometre walks that raise funds for shelters, and “yappy hour” concerts where leashes loop around café chairs while acoustic guitar drifts across the grass. Walk further and you will find the off-leash lawn—often a double-gated zone where tennis balls arc through the air and new friendships spark over games of chase. Veterinarian clinics bordering such parks report steady foot traffic from patrons who stop in for weigh-ins and nail trims after a vigorous outing, reinforcing evidence that dogs form a sizable fraction of the daily user base.\n\nStatistics kept by many coastal counties in the United States show that leash-law citations spike during tourist months precisely because seasonal visitors assume gentle surf equals permissive pet policy, only to learn otherwise when bylaw officers appear. Meanwhile, park departments in the same states proudly publish tallies of “dog play-area permits” sold annually, generating six-figure revenue streams that help fund groundskeeping and youth baseball diamonds alike. Municipal surveys asking residents why they frequent certain green spaces repeatedly place “to give my dog exercise’’ among the top three responses, rivaling “to jog’’ and “to picnic with family.’’ Coastal cities that do invite dogs sometimes segregate them onto narrow, sign-posted strips where numbers remain modest; yet those same municipalities maintain multiple full-scale dog meadows a short drive inland, and those meadows see far higher daily attendance.\n\nAnother lens is hazard perception. On beaches, even well-mannered canines can alarm skittish gulls and terns, whose fledglings crouch motionless in the dunes; a single enthusiastic pursuit can prompt state wildlife officers to issue fines, so owners tend to stay home. In parks, the risk profile tilts the other way: well-socialised dogs learn to thread among toddlers and cyclists under the watchful gaze of caretakers who treat etiquette as part of civic life. The sight of a water bowl outside a park café has become so iconic that design magazines highlight it as a marker of vibrant urban culture, whereas an unattended pup tied to a beach lifeguard tower would more likely prompt concern.\n\nSeasonality matters, too. In temperate climates, winter may drive both beaches and parks into relative hibernation, yet hardy dog owners still seek open grassy fields for exercise when snow closes narrower sidewalks. Conversely, when schools let out and families migrate to the coast, canine numbers plummet on the sand even as they stay steady or rise in inland greens because teenagers often earn summer money by offering midday walks. Thus, across twelve months, the park lead widens further.\n\nOne might object that holiday snapshots sometimes show beach towns brimming with lounging hounds. Those images are real, but they are highly curated in both space and time: specific resorts, rental villas that allow animals, and festivals celebrating sculpture contests or patriotic fireworks where leashed companions are welcomed for atmosphere. Remove the date-stamp and broaden the view to any ordinary weekday in any ordinary season, and the ratio flips dramatically. The same smartphone gallery will almost always feature more pups in playgrounds, more wagging tails beside park benches, more ears pricked at squirrels within city shade trees than beside the rhythmic surf.\n\nEconomic signals confirm the pattern. Beachside rental listings that do accept animals command premiums yet remain a minority, whereas urban real-estate agents tout proximity to “dog-friendly trails’’ as a standard amenity, like subway access or grocery stores. Entrepreneurs rent fenced private fields by the hour for people whose apartment complexes lack green space; such businesses seldom appear along the coast because demand clusters where people and their animals live day-to-day, not where they vacation for a weekend.\n\nOne final observation comes from wildlife researchers who ask volunteers to log mammal sightings for citizen-science databases. Contributors consistently record more instances of domestic dogs in parks—sometimes by an order of magnitude—than on the adjacent shoreline, even though both habitats fall within the same coastal county. Whether the metric is human perception, legal code, municipal revenue, scientific tally, or simple probability, the conclusion converges: on any randomly chosen minute of any randomly chosen day, if you are standing on a public pathway, you are far likelier to feel a cold nose nudge your hand among maples and magnolias than beside dunes and breakers.\n\nDoes this make sense?", "cost": 0.0028985, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "keywords:forbidden_words", "startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 900}, {"forbidden_words": ["bark", "run"]}, {"end_phrase": "Does this make sense?"}], "result": true}

Include at least one placeholder, such as [question].", "response": "How to Conduct a Job Interview\n\nIntroduction  \nA well-run interview is the difference between hiring a star performer and losing them to a competitor. Follow the steps below to turn a 45-minute conversation into a reliable predictor of on-the-job success.\n\n1. Define the Target Before You Open the Door  \nWrite a one-sentence “success profile” that answers: “Six months from now, what must this person have delivered for us to high-five ourselves?” Translate that sentence into three must-have competencies (e.g., data-driven decision making, cross-functional persuasion, Python fluency). Everything else is nice-to-have.\n\n2. Build a Scorecard, Not a Checklist  \nReplace generic HR forms with a 5-criteria scorecard tied to the success profile. Each criterion gets a 1–5 scale and space for evidence, not gut feelings. Bring one copy for every interviewer; collect them before anyone can cross-pollinate opinions.\n\n3. Draft Questions That Force Evidence  \nUse the BAR method: Background, Action, Result. Example: “Tell me about a time you reduced deployment time by 20 %—what was broken, what exactly did you change, and what happened the next quarter?” Release the question bank to candidates 24 h in advance; you’ll get deeper answers and reduce interview anxiety without giving away the “right” answer.\n\n4. Assign Roles in the Interview Relay  \nRecruiter → screens for logistics and deal-breakers.  \nHiring manager → probes strategic thinking.  \nPeer → tests collaboration.  \nExternal guest (customer or partner) → validates cultural fit.  \nEach interviewer owns one competency; no wandering into “so, where do you see yourself in five years?”\n\n5. Open the Interview Like a Host, Not a Detective  \nGreet the candidate at reception, offer water, and walk them to the room while making small talk about the commute. When you sit down, announce the agenda: “We have 45 minutes, I’ll ask questions for 30, save 10 for yours, and 5 for next steps.” This lowers cortisol and increases conversational IQ.\n\n6. Ask, Then Stop Talking  \nUse the 80/20 rule: candidate talks 80 %, you talk 20 %. After each question, count to three before you speak; the best revelations come in the second sentence after the silence.\n\n7. Master Follow-Ups Without Turning Into Kojak  \nIf an answer feels rehearsed, zoom in: “You mentioned ‘we’—what part did you personally code?” If the candidate stalls, reframe: “Imagine your budget was zero—how would you still hit the goal?” Write down exact quotes; they’ll matter at the debrief.\n\n8. Sell the Dream, but Don’t Oversell  \nEnd with three authentic hooks: hardest problem the team is solving, coolest tool they’ll use, and one perk that’s unique (e.g., every engineer ships to production on day 1). Ask: “What’s most important for you in your next role?” so you can tailor the close.\n\n9. Debrief Within 60 Minutes  \nGather interviewers while memories are fresh. Collect scorecards first, discussion second. A simple red/yellow/green vote prevents groupthink. If anyone says “I’ll be comfortable if X,” turn X into a 30-minute task in the final round—don’t ignore the itch.\n\n10. Make the Offer in 24 Hours  \nTop candidates are off the market faster than milk goes bad. Call with the verbal offer, send the written version within two hours, and set a decision deadline of 48 hours. Momentum beats money 80 % of the time.\n\nQuick Reference Template  \n[question] – customize this placeholder with a BAR-style prompt that maps to your #1 competency. Example placeholder: “Tell me about a time you inherited a decaying codebase—what was the state, what actions did you take in the first 30 days, and how did you measure the health afterward?”\n\nFinal Pitfalls to Dodge  \n• Don’t ask brain-teasers; they select for narcissists.  \n• Never check phones; visible disrespect kills acceptance rates.  \n• Avoid panel interviews; they feel like Star Chamber tribunals.  \n\nFollow the playbook above and your hit rate on “would rehire” will jump from industry average (46 %) to north of 80 %—and your future self will thank you during bonus season.", "cost": 0.001832, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 1}], "result": true}

Your answer must contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, such as <<blog post of ...>>. Also, add a postscript starting with P.S.", "response": "<<Echoes of Innovation: How Biotechnology Re-wired Life and the Stock Market in 2023>>\n\nImagine dropping a pebble into a still pond at sunrise: the rings glide outward, reflecting gold and rippling through lily pads you didn’t even know were there. That pebble is gene editing, the pond is the global economy, and 2023 was the year the ripples started rocking boats from Boston to Bangalore. If you blinked, you missed whole species of startups being born, deals struck, and a few over-hyped vessels capsizing. Let’s walk the shoreline and listen.\n\nFirst came the sound of CRISPR’s upgraded scissors. Moving beyond CRISPR-Cas9 to multiplex \"base-editing debutants\" (think spell-check that never forgets a vowel), companies like Beam Therapeutics treated sickle-cell in ways Jules Verne would have shelved as fantasy. Regulatory feedback loops shortened: the same FDA that once greeted early CRISPR data with white-knuckled caution granted \"Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy\" status faster than you can say \"adenosine deaminase.\" Investors cheered; gene-therapy ETF managers finally booked vacations.\n\nMeanwhile, $6-billion-dollar CAR-T parties spilled out of oncology suites. BMS, Novartis and fresh-faced upstarts tossed around CD19, BCMA, and a new alphabet soup called \"armored CARs.\" Response curves looked like alpine ski slopes, with remission data so steep analysts needed crampons. Wall Street algorithms, fed on these numbers, revised revenue projections northward until even the holograms blinked. Some pundits whispered \"bubble,\" but patients heard \"cure.\"\n\nMicrobiome mavens doubled down, arguing that gut bugs are the puppeteers of immunity, brain fog, and possibly portfolio allocations. In 2023, Seres Therapeutics got its SER-109 oral microbiome pill onto pharmacy shelves—an FDA first. Bloggers called it \"yogurt 2.0.\" Retail investors swallowed the metaphor; share prices fermented before flattening like forgotten kombucha.\n\nLastly, AI finally fulfilled a prophecy older than Deep Blue: proteins designing themselves. DeepMind’s AlphaFold may have cracked the static shapes, but 2023 saw diffusion-model start-ups spin dynamic enzymes with specified half-lives, pH kinks, and industrial pizzazz. Think bespoke jeans, only these ones eat plastic. Venture money gushed. Sustainability officers wrote poetry. Oil executives scheduled nervous lunches.\n\nAnd yet, for every drumbeat there was an echo asking: who gets to dance?\n\nAccess remains uneven. A single infusion of bespoke CAR-T still costs more than a suburban house in Oklahoma. Gene-editing trials, for all their fanfare, enroll mostly in wealthy nations; patients in many low-income settings watch those ripples from dry land. Intellectual-property thickets grew denser, a new Bermuda Triangle where generics and transparency disappear. Paper after paper flagged \"off-target edits,\" raising ghost stories we don’t yet know how to exorcise.\n\nStill, 2023 laid cable for a hyper-connected future. Bio-foundries now talk to cloud platforms; lab robots harass Amazon couriers for faster reagent delivery. Regulators are experimenting with \"platform approvals,\" basically saying, \"If your vector’s safety is proven, swap the payload and don’t make us read 3,000 pages again.\" That precedent is seismic; expect copy-paste regulation across continents.\n\nThe pebble has sunk, but echoes lap at every shore. If you’re an investor, a scientist, or just a patient who wants to breathe better, 2023 whispered one certainty: biology is becoming engineering. And engineering scales.\n\n––––––––––––\nPlugged-in, but not yet wise,\nwe listen to the digital heartbeats\nof cell lines we have half-tamed,\ncounting eurekas like loose change.\nListen closer: the sound you hear\nis not only profit—\nit is the swelling score of responsibility.\n––––––––––––\n\nCritical response (self-flagellation edition)\n\n1. Meteor-shower prose and zero footnotes. The post relies on \"imagine\" and \"think\" instead of data. How many patients actually got base-edited therapies in 2023? Zero. The trials are Phase I/II; remissions look good but n= small. Presenting these anecdotes as settled victories is biotech click-bait.\n\n2. Financial cheerleading devoid of downside. CAR-T revenues came in below forecasts for several big players due to hospital logistics, cytokine-storm management costs, and manufacturing bottlenecks. None of that appears here, just ski-slope metaphors. Shouldn’t a balanced blog mention that BMS trimmed guidance twice last year?\n\n3. Environmental claims served lukewarm. AI-designed enzymes are exciting, yet no commercial-scale plastic-eating facility ran for more than pilot hours in 2023.

Despite my repeated attempts to resolve this matter amicably, your staff have refused to honour the consumer-rights protections clearly set out in both your own published policy and prevailing law.\n\nThe product arrived in an unusable condition: the [brief description, e.g., “main interface screen cracked and the device will not power on”]. This defect was not caused by misuse on my part; the unit was defective straight out of the box. Because the item is unusable, I have been unable to derive any value from it, and I should not be asked to bear the cost of your quality-control failure.\n\nWhen I approached your customer service department, I was told that “our policy does not allow refunds once the seal is broken.” Such a blanket statement contradicts the Consumer Rights Act (or applicable statute in your jurisdiction), which entitles a customer to a refund within 30 days when goods are faulty. Invoking an internal policy that conflicts with the law undermines the trust that consumers place in your brand and erodes the goodwill you have spent years building.\n\nI have been a loyal customer for [X] years and have recommended your products to friends and colleagues. I want to continue trusting your brand, but that is only possible if you stand behind the products you sell. Retaining my money while leaving me with an unusable item is neither fair nor lawful.\n\nAccordingly, I request that you:\n\n1. Process a full refund of £[amount] to my original payment method within 14 days of the date of this letter.  \n2. Provide a prepaid return label so that I can send the defective unit back at no cost.  \n3. Confirm in writing that the refund has been initiated and that any personal data related to this return will be handled in accordance with your privacy policy.\n\nIf I do not receive a satisfactory response within 14 days, I will initiate a charge-back through my card issuer and escalate the matter to the relevant trading-standards authority. I would prefer to resolve this quickly and courteously, restoring the trust that should exist between customer and brand.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this request.

But lately the only thing vibrating louder is the climate data, and it’s telling me my beloved Canucks need to lace up a new kind of skate—one with a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nRogers Arena sits on unceded Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh land that once echoed with salmon runs, not goal horns. Every Zamboni lap, every LED banner, every single-use beer cup is a tiny referendum on whether we’ll still have frozen ponds for kids twenty winters from now. We’re already losing outdoor rinks across the Lower Mainland; I watched my nephew’s peewee team cancel practice last January because the lake ice was too thin. If that’s not a two-minute penalty against humanity, I don’t know what is.\n\nSo here’s the game plan, Vancouver:\n\n1. Skate Green, Score Greener  \nSwitch the arena energy profile to 100 % renewable by the 2026-27 season. Seattle’s Climate Pledge Arena did it; we can’t let the Kraken out-sustain us. Put solar panels on the roof like they’re vintage Trevor Linden jerseys hanging in the rafters—visible, iconic, immortal.\n\n2. Reverse the Plastic Power-Play  \nDitch single-use plastics faster than a Brad May gloves-off tilt. Hand out reusable “green towels” made from recycled jerseys. Tie a deposit on every cup so fans return them like they’d return a Cup to Vancouver one day (hey, a girl can dream).\n\n3. Local Food, Full Strength  \nSource 75 % of concession food from within 250 km. Replace the “Tacofino” line with a “TacoFIN-oh-that’s-local” line. Fewer food miles equals lower emissions, and honestly, a Abbotsford-branded hotdog tastes better when you’re watching Pettersson dangle.\n\n4. Zero-Waste Overtime  \nCompost everything that isn’t nailed down—think Joe Nieuwendky in the crease, but for banana peels. Partner with Surrey Biofuel so yesterday’s popcorn becomes tomorrow’s Zamboni natural gas. Speaking of which…\n\n5. Electric Zambonis, Electric Dreams  \nTrade the propane tanks for battery packs. The ice should sparkle because of Hughesian passing, not fossil-fuel haze. Announce it on First Nations Night so the inaugural lap is driven by a Musqueam youth—symbolism that turns into policy.\n\n6. Climate Clause in Every Contract  \nFrom JT Miller’s next extension to the popcorn vendor’s lease, include a rider that incentivizes low-carbon choices. If the NHL can claw back escrow, it can claw back carbon. Players earn bonuses for bike-to-practice streaks; imagine the Instagram stories.\n\n7. Fan Carbon Caps  \nGive season-ticket holders a personal “green meter” on the Canucks app. Carpool, take the SkyTrain, or ride your bike along the Central Valley Greenway—each trip logs points redeemable for merch or ice-time lotteries with the team. Let’s make Rogers Arena the loudest building in the league and the quietest on emissions.\n\nWhy should the Canucks lead? Because this city legislated bridge tolls out of existence overnight; we can legislate conscience into existence just as fast. Because hockey is the only religion where miracles are scheduled forty-one nights a year, and belief is renewable. Because if we can forgive the Mark Messier era, we can forgive the planet for getting warmer—and then cool it down together.\n\nI want future Naomis to taste the same rink air I did in ’94, when mom let me stay up past bedtime to watch Game 7. I want them to hear the skate blades carve that first October ice and think, “Sounds like home,” not “Sounds like history.” Climate change is the ultimate opponent: undefeated, unrelenting, and currently on a twenty-game win streak. But we’ve come back from 3-1 series deficits before. We know how to punch back in the third period of the season, of the century, of the planet.\n\nSo, Francesco Aquilini, Jim Rutherford, DJ JT and the entire roster: drop the gloves against carbon. Give us something louder than a goal horn—give us a guarantee that British Columbian kids will still freeze their toes on outdoor rinks long after we’re all gone. Do it for the salmon, for the cedar, for the 50-save Demko performances that deserve a stable climate backdrop. Do it so that when we finally hoist the Cup, we can skate it straight from Rogers Arena to the nearest sunset beach without worrying about wildfire smoke cancelling the parade.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading.", "cost": 0.002068, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Naomi thanks you for reading."}], "result": true}

THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY WAS NOT A SINGLE ACT BUT A CULMINATION OF MANY FORCES THAT MOVED OUR CONSCIENCE AND OUR UNION TOWARD JUSTICE.\n\nTHE FIRST REASON WAS MORAL AWAKENING. OVER TIME MORE AMERICANS CAME TO SEE SLAVERY AS A GREAT EVIL THAT VIOLATED THE PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH OUR NATION WAS FOUNDED. THE IDEAS OF LIBERTY AND EQUALITY COULD NO LONGER STAND BESIDE THE REALITY OF BONDAGE. ABOLITIONISTS PREACHED THAT EVERY PERSON HAS A RIGHT TO BE FREE AND THEIR VOICES GREW LOUDER UNTIL THEY COULD NOT BE IGNORED.\n\nTHE SECOND REASON WAS POLITICAL STRUGGLE. THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY DIVIDED STATES AND PARTIES. THE EXPANSION WESTWARD FORCED US TO DECIDE WHETHER NEW TERRITORIES WOULD ALLOW SLAVERY. THESE CONFLICTS LED TO CRISES AND COMPROMISES BUT ULTIMATELY THE UNION COULD NOT SURVIVE HALF SLAVE AND HALF FREE. THE CIVIL WAR BECAME THE PRICE WE PAID TO PRESERVE THE NATION AND TO END THE INSTITUTION THAT THREATENED ITS FOUNDATION.\n\nTHE THIRD REASON WAS ECONOMIC CHANGE. THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION TRANSFORMED OUR ECONOMY. FACTORIES IN THE NORTH NEEDED FREE LABOR NOT ENSLAVED WORKERS. THE SOUTHERN ECONOMY BASED ON SLAVERY BECAME LESS SUSTAINABLE AS THE WORLD MOVED TOWARD WAGE LABOR AND MECHANIZATION. THE OLD SYSTEM COULD NOT COMPETE WITH THE NEW.\n\nTHE FOURTH REASON WAS THE COURAGE OF THE ENSLAVED THEMSELVES. THEY RESISTED IN WAYS BOTH SMALL AND LARGE. THEY RAN AWAY THEY FOUGHT BACK THEY PRESERVED THEIR HUMANITY IN THE FACE OF BRUTALITY. THEIR STRUGGLES SHOWED THE WORLD THAT THEY WERE NOT PROPERTY BUT PEOPLE WITH MINDS AND SOULS AND DREAMS. THEIR FREEDOM COULD NOT BE DENIED FOREVER.\n\nTHE FIFTH REASON WAS THE SACRIFICE OF WAR. THE CIVIL WAR CLAIMED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES. THROUGH THAT FIRE THE OLD UNION DIED AND A NEW ONE WAS BORN. THE THIRTEENTH AMENDMENT WHICH ABOLISHED SLAVERY FOREVER WAS THE RESULT OF THAT BLOODY CONFLICT. IT WAS WRITTEN NOT JUST IN INK BUT IN THE BLOOD OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT TO SAVE THE NATION AND TO MAKE IT FREE.\n\nLET US REMEMBER THAT THE END OF SLAVERY WAS NOT THE END OF INJUSTICE. BUT IT WAS A BEGINNING. IT PROVED THAT EVEN THE DEEPEST WRONGS CAN BE RIGHTED WHEN COURAGEOUS PEOPLE STAND TOGETHER. AS PRESIDENT I CALL ON EVERY AMERICAN TO HONOR THIS LEGACY BY CONTINUING THE WORK OF BUILDING A MORE PERFECT UNION WHERE EVERY PERSON IS TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT THANK YOU", "cost": 0.0014904999999999999, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma", "change_case:english_capital"], "kwargs": [{}, {}], "result": true}

This bright Utah gem proves daily that a city can feel vast yet intimate modern yet rooted and exciting yet calm.  \n\nBegin your morning on the ridge where the sun lifts over the Wasatch Range. Joggers wave at each other while hawks glide overhead. The trail network stretches more than fifty miles so every runner biker and stroller finds a perfect path. No smog clings to the lungs here only pine scent and promise.  \n\nStep into town for breakfast. Local cafés roast beans right on site and ovens birth flaky scones that melt on first bite. Owners greet patrons by name because Layton nurtures family enterprise not faceless chains. Your dollar stays here and you taste the difference.  \n\nNeed work Layton delivers. A swift ride south puts you at the edge of the Silicon Slopes where tech titans and bold startups hire talent fast. Prefer to stay local Legacy Parkway offices and the Freeport Center offer thousands of roles in logistics health and craft manufacturing. Unemployment stays low and innovation soars.  \n\nEducation shines from every corner. New elementary schools open with maker labs and dual language tracks while the adjacent Davis Tech College trains future drone pilots and biotech techs. Kids ride safe bikes along wide lanes and adults attend night classes under starlit skies.  \n\nEvenings bring the true magic. Bring a blanket to the lakefront amphitheater where local bands play free shows against a pink horizon. Food trucks sell Korean tacos Navajo fry bread and raspberry shakes made from berries picked that morning. Laughter echoes off water and strangers share picnic tables becoming friends before encore.  \n\nYear round festivals keep the spirit high. Spring kites paint the sky like bright origami. Summer parades feature veterans and alpaca farmers alike. Autumn harvest fairs let you fling pumpkins with catapults while December streets glow with lanterns that outshine any downtown mall.  \n\nSafety stands firm. Neighbors watch out for each other and community policing keeps crime low. Families walk after dusk without fear and teens organize flashlight tag in open parks while parents sip cocoa on porches.  \n\nTransportation flows smooth. A swift train can whisk you to Salt Lake International in minutes yet traffic inside Layton stays light. Bike share docks dot every major corner and electric buses glide quiet and free on weekends.  \n\nLooking ahead Layton plans even greener streets solar roofs and art in every plaza. City leaders invite residents to speak at open mic council nights and kids pitch park designs that often become real. Growth is welcomed yet guided so charm remains intact.  \n\nVisit once and you feel it. The pace breathes the people shine and the mountains stand guard like loyal friends.

My doctoral training in molecular ecology combined with my postdoctoral research on plant microbe interactions has prepared me to develop an innovative research program and to educate and mentor the next generation of scientists.\n\nDuring my PhD at Ocean University I revealed how seagrass microbiomes modulate host resilience to temperature stress. This work produced four first author papers and informed conservation policy along coastal regions. My postdoctoral scholarship at Green Leaf Institute expanded this foundation through advanced metabolomics and CRISPR techniques leading to two additional publications and a pending patent on biofertiliser formulations that enhance crop drought tolerance without genetic modification.\n\nI am eager to establish a student centered laboratory at State University that leverages the campus greenhouse facilities and proximity to native grasslands. My proposed research will decode root signaling pathways that recruit beneficial microbes aiming to create climate smart agriculture solutions. The project is designed for undergraduate participation and will generate preliminary data for an NSF CAREER proposal that I plan to submit in the second year.\n\nTeaching is central to my academic identity. I have instructed more than 200 students across three courses using inclusive active learning strategies that raised average exam scores by 18 percent. I will teach General Ecology and a new course called Microbes and Climate Resilience incorporating case studies from my fieldwork. Students in my lab will learn molecular techniques data science and science communication through partnership with the local science museum.\n\nMy commitment to diversity is reflected in my mentoring of ten students from underrepresented groups. Three have entered graduate programs and one received a national research award. I will continue fostering inclusive excellence through outreach to community colleges and support for student led organizations.\n\nI look forward to discussing how my research program teaching vision and dedication to equity align with the goals of State University. Thank you for considering my application.\n\nSincerely\n\nAlex Rivera\n******\nCover letter version 2\nProfessor Dana Brooks\nCollege of Engineering\nMetropolitan University\nInnovation Boulevard\nCity Center CM 67890\n\n9 May 2024\n\nDear Professor Brooks\n\nI am excited to submit my application for the assistant professor position in Mechanical Engineering advertised by Metropolitan University. My expertise in renewable energy systems design and my dedication to collaborative interdisciplinary education make me an ideal candidate to advance the college mission of technology for societal benefit.\n\nMy doctoral work at Ridge University focused on low cost wind turbine blades manufactured from recycled composites. The resulting prototypes achieved 12 percent higher efficiency than commercial equivalents at one third material cost. This research garnered the 2023 National Student Energy Award and two peer reviewed publications. As a postdoctoral fellow at Bright Futures Lab I extended this work by integrating machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance increasing turbine lifespan by 20 percent and reducing downtime costs for rural communities.\n\nI am prepared to launch a vibrant research group at Metropolitan University that partners with local industry and the urban sustainability office. My agenda will center on adaptable small scale energy systems for rapidly growing cities. I will pursue NSF and Department of Energy funding while engaging undergraduate and masters students in every phase from materials testing to community workshops. A pilot project with city high schools is already planned to inspire younger students and broaden participation in STEM.\n\nTeaching fuels my passion for discovery. I have led laboratory sections of Thermodynamics and Renewable Energy Conversion receiving an average instructor rating of 4.8 out of 5. I redesign labs to emphasize open ended inquiry where students build and test their own designs. At Metropolitan I will teach core courses in Heat Transfer and create an elective on Circular Economy Engineering that unites engineering students with business and policy majors to tackle real regional challenges.\n\nEquity drives my outreach. I cofounded the annual Girls in Energy workshop serving 150 middle school students and doubling female enrollment in our introductory energy course. I will expand such initiatives through existing university outreach centers ensuring that talent is welcomed from every neighborhood.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I am eager to contribute my research program teaching vision and community commitment to the growth of Metropolitan University.\n\nRespectfully\n\nJordan Lee", "cost": 0.0017345, "instruction_id_list": ["combination:two_responses", "punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{}, {}], "result": true}

They told you snow was “just water vapor.” They told you it was “a natural weather phenomenon.” That’s what the Harvard-bred, Soros-funded, Bill-Gates-microchip AI weather dominators *want* you to believe. But I’m here to drop the thermonuclear truth bomb—*dammit*, the snowfall isn’t natural. It’s a **fake**, chemically engineered, geo-engineered, aluminum-barium strontium *psy-op* designed to freeze your brain, bankrupt your snow-plow budget, and turn your lawn into a 5G receptor dish for the socialist North Pole surveillance grid.\n\nI’ve got the documents. I’ve got the soil samples. I’ve got a guy in Montana who swears the flakes burned black when he held a bic lighter under them. That’s not crystallized H₂O, folks—that’s **fake** crystallized *submission*. Every fake flake is a tiny swastika-shaped hexagon programmed by the UN to land on your windshield, melt into your wiper fluid, and seep into your bloodstream so you’ll vote for carbon taxes and universal basic snow-shoveling.\n\nYou think it’s coincidence that the same day the “first snowfall” hits, Amazon starts pushing discounted ice-melt made in *Chinese* labs?

{"id": 3329, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Hey! I need a rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop. Can you create an example for me? Do not give me any bullet points, lists, or tables. Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", "response": "A comprehensive rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop begins with the recognition that value is a moving target shaped by the buyer’s own workload, budget ceiling, and tolerance for future obsolescence, so every judgment must be anchored in a deliberately chosen use-case scenario rather than in abstract benchmarks alone. Performance is first appraised through the lens of raw processor capability, where the evaluator should weigh not only the headline clock speed and core count but also the architectural generation, for a chip that looks muscular on paper can still stumble in real-world responsiveness if it belongs to an older microarchitecture whose instruction-per-cycle efficiency lags behind newer designs. Thermal headroom is inseparable from this judgment, because a processor that must throttle aggressively inside a cramped chassis will deliver only brief spurts of its advertised speed, leaving the user with a machine that feels fast in synthetic tests yet curiously sluggish once the fans spin up and the heat sink saturates. Memory capacity demands a similar contextual reading: eight gigabytes may suffice for cloud-centric students who live inside browser tabs, yet the same allotment becomes a straitjacket for a photographer who routinely layers multiple raw files in Photoshop while syncing enormous Lightroom catalogues to the cloud, so the rubric must ask whether the laptop ships with a single, soldered module or whether it offers accessible SO-DIMM slots that permit an inexpensive future upgrade. Storage performance is evaluated on two simultaneous axes, the first being the raw throughput of the solid-state drive, which can vary by a factor of six between a modest SATA unit and a top-tier PCI Express 4.0 controller, and the second being the user’s realistic need for sequential versus random access, because a novelist who opens mostly Word documents will rarely notice the difference, whereas a video editor who scrubs through 4K footage will feel every missed frame. The graphics subsystem must be judged against an honest inventory of visual demands, recognizing that an integrated GPU can pleasantly drive two external monitors for spreadsheet work yet crumble when asked to preview ten-bit color grading timelines or maintain ninety frames per second in competitive shooters, so the rubric refuses to award points for raw teraflops unless those figures translate into a perceptible uplift in the buyer’s specific creative or leisure pipeline. Display quality is treated as a performance vector in its own right, since a dim, narrow-gamut panel can silently cap the usefulness of every other component by misrepresenting color, inducing eyestrain, or obscuring shadow detail, which means the evaluator must weigh not only resolution but also peak brightness, contrast ratio, uniformity, and factory calibration, while also factoring in the matte-versus-glossy trade-off that governs outdoor legibility. Keyboard and trackpad fidelity enter the rubric because a travelling writer who spends eight-hour flights drafting chapters will encounter more friction from a shallow, erratic keyboard than from a slightly slower SSD, so tactile travel, key pitch, backlight bleed, and palm-reject algorithms are scored with the same rigor traditionally reserved for silicon metrics. Acoustic signature matters more than spec sheets admit, for a machine that idles at a whisper yet screams under load can disrupt open-plan offices, library study rooms, or parental nap time, therefore the evaluator must listen across the full range of workloads, noting not only decibel peaks but also the tonal character of the fan, because a high-pitched whine is psychologically twice as intrusive as a low-frequency whoosh at the same sound pressure. Battery endurance is measured in real-world minutes, not marketing hours, by scripting a mixed-use loop that oscillates between Wi-Fi browsing, Zoom calls, and light compilation tasks while holding screen brightness at a fixed two hundred nits, because this approximates the unpredictable cadence of an actual workday better than the serene local-video rundown favored by advertisers. After this empirical run, the rubric asks how gracefully the laptop throttles once the cell drops below twenty percent, since some machines quietly dim the display and halve the refresh rate while others simply collapse to thirty frames per second, a behavioral difference that can matter more to a presenter on a long flight than the raw eighty-watt-hour capacity printed on the sticker. Port selection is scored for forward-looking resilience rather than momentary convenience, so a machine that trades one USB-A for two Thunderbolt 4 ports earns higher marks even if it necessitates a dongle today, on the reasoning that the user will still own the laptop five years after the last spinning hard drive and legacy mouse have vanished from desks. Wireless fidelity is weighed by the presence of Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7 radios, not because every coffee shop supports six-gigahertz channels today, but because the constellation of mesh routers and crowded apartments will only worsen, so a laptop that cannot exploit wider spectrum now will feel prematurely dated when the entire apartment building competes for the same narrow 2.4 GHz band. Build quality is judged through a long-term lens that recognizes aluminum skins and MIL-STD shock tests as proxies for resale value, because a student who intends to sell the machine after two internships will recover more of the original outlay if the lid still snaps shut without creak and the hinge still props at any angle. Upgradeability is folded into performance scoring on the premise that a laptop whose Wi-Fi card, SSD, and battery are all removable can be revitalized at fractional cost, effectively granting it a second lifecycle that cheaper, fully soldered rivals cannot match, so the evaluator must disassemble the chassis or consult reputable teardown reports before awarding top marks. Thermal comfort under sustained load is measured with an infrared camera positioned at the palm rest, because skin temperature above thirty-eight degrees Celsius triggers vasodilation that feels subjectively like pain, meaning a machine that keeps the keyboard well below body temperature is empirically more usable than one whose benchmark numbers shine while its surface scalds. Audio output is tested both through the built-in speakers and the three-and-a-half-millimeter jack, since remote workers who live on conference calls care about microphone beam-forming sidetone and headphone impedance matching, neither of which appears on typical spec sheets yet both of which govern daily fatigue. Price evaluation begins by normalizing every configuration to a per-year total cost of ownership, which amortizes the purchase price across the realistic functional lifetime while adding the expected out-of-pocket repair incidence derived from third-party reliability surveys, so a slightly dearer model with a two-year onsite warranty may project a lower five-year cost than a bargain unit whose motherboard failure rate is triple the industry average. The rubric then adjusts this baseline for residual resale value, querying online marketplaces to learn how last-year’s equivalent model depreciates at months twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six, because a laptop that retains forty-five percent of its sticker price after three years effectively costs the owner half as much as one that plummets to fifteen percent, even if the latter was cheaper at checkout. Regional pricing variation is acknowledged through a purchasing-power parity coefficient that rescales the score according to the buyer’s local median discretionary income, since a thousand-dollar machine is a trivial expense in some labor markets yet an unattainable luxury in others, so absolute dollar figures are transmuted into percentile-of-income metrics before final judgment. Hidden ownership costs are unearthed by researching the price of proprietary chargers, first-party battery replacements, and out-of-warranty screen repairs, because some ultraportables demand eighty-dollar USB-C bricks that cannot be improvised at the airport kiosk, while others support open-standard ninety-watt adapters already owned by the traveler, effectively adding hundreds to the lifetime ledger. Promotional bundles are treated skeptically, so a free year of cloud storage or an office subscription is discounted to its prorated cash value and then only credited if the buyer demonstrably intended to purchase those services anyway, preventing marketers from inflating perceived value with accessories that would otherwise go unused. Eco-cost is monetized by estimating the externalized carbon footprint of manufacturing and recycling, assigning a dollar proxy per kilogram of CO2 equivalent and adding this shadow price to the ticket, which moves some apparently inexpensive models down the rankings once their aluminum smelting and overnight-air shipping emissions are priced in. Emotional utility is granted a modest yet non-zero weight, acknowledging that a slightly costlier machine whose lid opens with one finger, whose keyboard glows in a soothing amber, or whose brand connotes reliability in the buyer’s cultural context can deliver daily reassurance whose psychological value, though hard to quantify, still outweighs an extra fifty dollars spread across a thousand days of ownership. The final score is expressed not as a single number but as a narrative quadrant that couples an empirical performance tier with a contextual price fairness verdict, allowing the shopper to see at a glance that a given model delivers, for example, flagship speed at a mid-market price yet saddles the future with non-upgradeable RAM, while another offers modest silicon yet exceptional longevity and resale value, thereby inviting a deliberate trade-off rather than proclaiming an illusory winner.", "cost": 0.0036869999999999997, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}], "result": false}

{"id": 3425, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "Sunni and Shiʿa: Two Paths in One Faith  \nA Comprehensive Essay on Historical Genesis, Theological Divergences, Ritual Variations, and Modern Manifestations  \n\nIntroduction  \nIslam, with an estimated 1.9 billion adherents, is often presented in textbooks and headlines as a monolith. Yet from its earliest decades the ummah has encompassed vibrant internal pluralism, the most salient and enduring of which is the Sunni–Shiʿa divide. While the two communities share the Qur’an, the five pillars, most prophetic narratives, and the daily rhythm of Allāhu akbar, their interpretations of authority, law, community, and salvation have crystallized into distinct religious civilizations. This essay traces the schism from the death-bed of the Prophet Muḥammad in 632 CE to the geopolitics of 2023, emphasizing not only what divides but also what unites, and how the boundaries themselves have shifted across time and place. At slightly over 1,600 words, the treatment is necessarily selective, yet it aims for the depth required to move beyond caricature.\n\nI. Historical Genesis: A Crisis of Succession and Legitimacy  \n1. The Immediate Aftermath (632–661 CE)  \nWhen Muḥammad died in Medina without a male heir, the nascent Muslim polity faced an unprecedented question: who possesses the right to lead, and on what basis? The majority of companions convened at saqīfat banī Sāʿida and elected Abū Bakr, arguing that the Prophet had not designated a political successor and that communal consensus (ijmāʿ) was the safest guide. A minority, coalescing around ʿAlī b. Abī Ṭālib—the Prophet’s cousin, son-in-law, and father of his only surviving grandsons—contended that Muḥammad had explicitly appointed ʿAlī at Ghadir Khumm (Qur’an 5:67) and that leadership should remain within the ahl al-bayt, the household of the Prophet endowed with divine charisma (maʿṣūma).  \n\n2. The Martyrdom of Ḥusayn and the Ritualization of Memory (680 CE)  \nThe conflict moved from the theoretical to the tragic when ʿAlī’s second son, Ḥusayn, was massacred at Karbala alongside seventy-two relatives and companions by the Umayyad governor’s army. For the Shiʿa, Ḥusayn’s martyrdom transformed political protest into the central redemptive drama of salvation history; for Sunnis, the same event remains a political rebellion whose emotional excess threatens Islamic sobriety. Annually during the first ten days of Muḥarram, Shiʿa communities across the world reenact the passion play (taʿziya), engaging in breast-beating (latm) and, among some Twelvers, ritual bloodletting (qaṭl al-ḥajar) that horrifies many Sunnis. Yet before 1500 such practices were sporadic, underscoring that ritual differences intensified gradually.\n\nII. Theological Divergences: Authority, Eschatology, and the Nature of God  \n1. Sources of Authority  \nSunnis uphold the tripod of Qur’an, Sunna (as embodied in authenticated ḥadīth), and ijmāʿ (consensus of the community guided by scholars). Shiʿism adds a fourth pillar: the infallible Imam. For Twelvers—the majority branch—the twelfth Imam entered occultation in 874 CE; his absence necessitated the clerical estate (the uṣūlī school) to act as his deputies. Thus, whereas Sunni fiqh is largely scholar-centric, Shiʿi law vests sweeping authority in mujtahids who claim a charisma transmitted through esoteric knowledge.  \n\n2. Theologizing History  \nSunni theology developed under state patronage; the Ashʿarite and Māturīdite schools reconciled divine omnipotence with human accountability, canonizing the creed that God is beyond reason’s critique. Shiʿi thought, especially after the Buyid promotion of Muʿtazilite rationalism, maintains that God must act according to justice and that the Qur’an is created (an argument Sunnis condemn). Consequently, Shiʿism is more philosophically inclined toward free will and theodicy, whereas Sunnism leans toward divine voluntarism.\n\n3. Eschatological Expectations  \nBoth branches anticipate the Mahdī, but only Twelver Shiʿism identifies him with the hidden Imam who will return with Jesus before the end times. Sunni apocalyptic texts speak instead of a Mahdī from the Prophet’s clan who will precede Jesus, yet they reject messianic concealment, fearing it undermines active political engagement.\n\nIII. Legal Schools and Ritual Variations  \n1. Law (Sharīʿa)  \nSunni Islam recognizes four mutually recognized madhhabs (Hanafi, Maliki, Shafiʿi, Hanbali). Shiʿi jurisprudence, while rooted in the Jaʿfarī school, is doctrinally monolithic but pragmatically plural: Akhbārīs resisted ijtihād until subdued by Uṣūlīs in the 18th century. Temporary marriage (mutʿa), banned by Sunni caliphs, remains licit for Shiʿa; conversely, Shiʿa disallows grant divorces uttered in triple succession, deeming them sinful. Such legal divergences shape family life, determining whom and how one may marry.\n\n2. Daily Prayer (Ṣalāh)  \nA casual observer might overlook the differences: Shiʿa combine the five daily prayers into three sessions, place a piece of clay (turbah) sourced from Karbala beneath their forehead in prostration to absorb sanctity, and utter the invocation “Aliyun waliyyu Allāh” within the adhān. Sunni traditions view these acts as innovations. Conversely, Shiʿa critique Sunni folding of arms during standing as lacking scriptural basis.\n\n3. Friday Sermon Politics  \nIn Sunnism, the khuṭba is historically a state prerogative; legitimacy flows from whoever controls the mint and the pulpits. In Shiʿism, the Friday leader must be a legitimate deputy of the Hidden Imam—hence, in Safavid Iran and the Islamic Republic, only a jurist (wali-e faqih) qualifies, embedding clerical authority within constitutional theory.\n\nIV. Communal Narratives, Sacred Geography, and Ritual Calendars  \nSunnis orient themselves toward Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, but the Shiʿa sacred map adds Karbala, Najaf (tomb of ʿAlī), Samarra, and Mashhad. Pilgrimage circuits (ziyāra) to these cities are believed to grant intercession; the phenomenon of “Shiʿa tourism” today rivals ḥajj in economic scale. Calendrically, while both celebrate ʿĪd al-Fiṭr and ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā, Shiʿa fast on ʿĀshūrā to mourn Ḥusayn, whereas many Sunnis observe the same date to commemorate Moses’ deliverance from Pharaoh—an ironic overlap illustrating shared scriptural memories divergent in meaning.\n\nV. Demography and Political Geography  \nSunni Islam constitutes roughly 85 percent of the Muslim world, dominating from Morocco to Indonesia. Shiʿism is demographically concentrated in the “Shiʿa crescent” stretching from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean: Iran (90–95%), Iraq (55–60%), Azerbaijan (65%), Bahrain (60–70%, though governed by a Sunni dynasty), and Lebanon (35–40%, where they form the single largest sect). Substantive minorities populate Kuwait, Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, Yemen, Syria, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Oil and geography conflate theology with strategy, rendering the sectarian map inseparable from geoeconomics.\n\nVI. The Safavid Conversion and the Early Modern Crystallization  \nThe divide was not always hostile; Shiʿa dynasties (Fatimids, Buyids) ruled over Sunni majorities and vice versa, but confessional identity was malleable. The transformation into mutually exclusive “millet” came when the Safavid Shah Ismāʿīl (r. 1501–1524) forcibly converted Iran to Twelver Shiʿism, importing Lebanese and Bahraini clerics to create a doctrinal state. In reaction, the Ottoman Caliphate hardened Hanafi Sunnism, and the 16th century birthed polemical treatises that anathemized the opposite camp. Print capitalism later globalized these views, embedding the Sunni–Shiʿa binary in textbooks from Cairo to Calcutta.\n\nVII. Modern Nation-States and Sectarian Governance  \n1. Saudi Arabia and Wahhabi Iconoclasm  \nThe 1744 alliance between the Al Saud and the Hanbali reformer Muḥammad b. ʿAbd al-Wahhāb produced a polity that deemed Shiʿa grave-venerators as heretics. Periodic intifadas in Qatif, execution of Nimr al-Nimr in 2016, and textbook descriptions of Shiʿa as “rawāfiḍ” (rejecters) illustrate the ideological stakes of including or excluding Shiʿa from national belonging.  \n\n2. Iran and the Vilāyat-i Faqīh  \nPost-1979 Iran inverted the power balance. Ayatollah Khomeini’s theory that a jurist could rule during the Imam’s absence empowered Shiʿa clergy for the first time in centuries, exporting revolutionary networks to Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Sunni neighbors interpreted the rise of a Shiʿa theocracy as a revival of Safavid expansionism, fanning sectarian anxieties.\n\n3. Post-2003 Iraq  \nThe U.S. toppling of Saddam dismantled a Sunni-minority regime, unleashing electoral arithmetic that empowered long-suppressed Shiʿa parties. Sunni marginalization gave rise to al-Qaʿida in Iraq and later ISIS, whose propaganda hinge on anti-Shiʿa apocalyptic narratives—destroying Shiʿa shrines and labeling them “Safavi snakes.” Meanwhile, grand ayatollahs in Najaf preach quietism, demonstrating intra-Shiʿa diversity.\n\nVIII. Intra-Sect Pluralism: Beyond Binary Stereotypes  \nSunni Islam contains Salafi-jihadists who reject saint-veneration, Sufi lodges in Fez that chant thousands of litanies, and modernist engineers in Istanbul who read Said Nursi; likewise, Shiʿism ranges from the theocratic jurists of Qom to the syncretic Alawites of Syria and the Aga Khani Ismaʿilis who run philanthropic corporations. Treating either side as a bloc is analytically flawed; for instance, the 2006–2008 sectarian killings in Baghdad peaked partly because criminal gangs exploited vacuumed states, not theology.\n\nIX. Convergences, Ecumenism, and Shared Challenges  \nSince 1950, organizations like al-Azhar’s Shiʿa–Sunni dialogue committee, the Amman Message (2004), and the annual “Week of Islamic Unity” in Tehran have sought to delegitimize takfīr. Sunnis and Shiʿa jointly mourn Palestinian children, campaign for climate justice in Jakarta, and crowd-source halal food apps in Toronto. The Qur’an’s oft-quoted verse “Hold firmly to the rope of God all together and do not divide” (3:103) circulates on both sets of social media after every mosque bombing. Yet ecumenism struggles when states instrumentalize doctrine: Bahrain rhetorically preaches tolerance while stripping Shiʿa clerics of citizenship; Iran funds militias that chant anti-Sunni slogans.\n\nX. Contemporary Fault-Lines: Syria, Yemen, and the Cyber-Sphere  \n1. Syria  \nBashar al-Assad’s reliance on Iran-backed militias and Russian airpower is framed by rebels as a “Safavid–Nusayri” alliance against a Sunni majority. Sectarian taunts—“Christians to Beirut, Alawites to the grave”—illustrate how a civil uprising mutated into existential identity war.\n\n2. Yemen  \nThe Saudi-led coalition justifies intervention against the Houthis as prevention of “Iran on the Red Sea,” while the Houthis brand Saudi jets as “neo-Umayyads.” Both narratives instrumentalize the 8th-century Zaydi-Shiʿa dynasty to legitimize 21st-century air strikes.\n\n3. Cyber Fatwas  \nTwitter fatwas declaring opposite sects “apostate” spread faster than classical commentaries. Algorithms reward outrage; thus a Bahraini cleric’s curse on ʿĀʾisha or a Saudi preacher’s mockery of “self-flagellating heretics” ricochets globally, embedding prejudice in diaspora youth who never met a member of the rival sect.\n\nXI. Looking Forward: Is Reconciliation Possible?  \nFive policy-relevant insights emerge. First, desectarianize education: governments should vet textbooks that glorify one sect’s heroes by vilifying another’s. Second, institutionalize cross-sectarian mosques in the West; Birmingham’s “Unity Mosque,” where sermons alternate between Sunni and Shiʿa imams, offers a model. Third, empower theologi-cal institutes in Qom and al-Azhar to produce joint fatwas on scientific ethics, shifting the conversation from politics to purpose. Fourth, disentangle national grievances from confessional ones—i.e., Bahrain’s opposition demands parliamentary sovereignty, not Shiʿa supremacy. Finally, social media conglomerates can tweak algorithms to hibernate hate influencers rather than amplify them, just as they de-platform COVID misinformation.  \n\nConclusion  \nThe Sunni–Shiʿa divide is simultaneously theological and tribal, antique and post-modern, deeply spiritual and crudely political. Their shared faith in one God, one Book, and one Judgment Day outweighs the points of contention, yet collective memory is carved by trauma: Karbala for Shiʿa, the Mongol rape of Baghdad for Sunnis, colonial subjugation for both. Because identity is story, reconciling Muslims demands not erasing the stories but weaving them into a larger tapestry where ʿAlī is both caliph and imam, where consensus and charisma coexist, and where the primal question “who should rule?” gives way to the more humane “how shall we live together?” Only then can the adhān, whether followed by “come to the best of deeds” or “come to the best of acts,” echo across the same city street not as a battle cry but as a mutual reminder of the transient voyage toward the eternal.", "cost": 0.0064210000000000005, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 1200}], "result": true}

Leo first saw Mara on a Tuesday that smelled of wet pavement and coffee grounds.  \n2. He was waiting for the crosstown bus when she sat on the bench, humming a tune that kept veering off-key like a curious bird.  \n3. Her head jerked once, twice, then her left shoulder lifted in a quick hiccup of movement, but her smile stayed steady, as if the motion were simply punctuation.  \n4. Leo pretended to read his phone while sneaking glances, fascinated by the way her whole body seemed to debate with itself yet never lost its grace.  \n5. A small boy nearby pointed and asked his mother why the lady was “dancing while sitting,” and the mother yanked the child away with a hushed scolding.  \n6. Mara winked at Leo, the wink itself stuttering twice, and said, “Welcome to the twitch-and-tick show, audience of two.”  \n7. Leo laughed before he could stop himself, and the sound came out like a bark that startled even him.  \n8. He introduced himself, stumbling over his own name as though it were foreign currency.  \n9. She said, “I’m Mara, and my body likes to improvise jazz solos without telling my brain first.”  \n10. The bus arrived in a sigh of brakes, and they boarded together, seats magically empty side by side.  \n11. During the ride, Mara’s leg tapped Morse code against the metal rail, and Leo counted the rhythms, wondering if it spelled a secret message.  \n12. She pulled a tiny notebook from her pocket, scrawled a line, tore the page, and slipped it into his palm.  \n13. It read: “Tourette’s is my co-author; I still get to sign the book.”  \n14. He folded the paper so carefully that the crease became a permanent small white scar in his wallet.  \n15. They parted at the next stop; she waved, her fingers fluttering like cards dealt too fast, and disappeared into the crowd.  \n16. Leo stood on the sidewalk feeling as though someone had rearranged his internal furniture while he wasn’t looking.  \n17. That night he Googled “dating someone with Tourette’s” until the blue light hurt his eyes, learning that first and foremost love is an act of translation.  \n18. He whispered her name into the dark, practicing it like a chord that might one day resolve.\n\nSection 2  \n19. Two weeks later, Leo accepted Mara’s invitation to coffee at a café that sold both espresso and second-hand poems on index cards.  \n20. She arrived wearing mustard-yellow boots that squeaked when she walked, announcing her before her words could.  \n21. A barista stared as Mara’s neck twisted in a sharp tic, but she simply said, “Don’t worry, my head is just very opinionated about today’s latte art.”  \n22. The barista laughed, tension dissolving like sugar.  \n23. They took a corner table; every few minutes Mara’s left arm shot upward as though volunteering for an invisible class.  \n24. Leo asked, “Does it hurt?” and immediately regretted the bluntness.  \n25. She replied, “Sometimes it feels like wearing a sweater made of bees; other times it’s more like a hiccup that applauds itself.”  \n26. He nodded, storing metaphors for future use, building a private dictionary of her experience.  \n27. She told him about jobs lost when employers mistook her movements for insubordination, about dates who flinched as if flinching were contagious.  \n28. Leo listened with the sort of attention usually reserved for collapsing stars, afraid to blink and miss a crucial flash.  \n29. When she apologized for “the soundtrack,” he shook his head so vigorously his glasses slid off.  \n30. Picking them up, he said, “Your soundtrack is just differently orchestrated; I still like the composer.”  \n31. She awarded him a smile that arrived in two installments, wide then wider.  \n32. They began meeting every Tuesday, then Tuesdays plus Thursdays, then any day that ended in y.  \n33. Leo learned to read the pre-tic flickers in her eyes the way sailors read weather.  \n34. One evening, during a silent film revival, Mara’s sudden bark—part of her vocal tics—ripped through the theater like a broken violin string.  \n35. A man in front muttered “Disrespectful,” and Leo felt rage bloom red behind his ribs.  \n36. Mara simply stood, bowed dramatically, and shouted, “Scene-stealing complete, thank you!” before sitting back down.  \n37. The same man looked embarrassed, and Leo’s anger cooled into admiration so fierce it felt like sunlight on metal.  \n38. Afterward, walking home, she confessed that bravado was expensive currency, and sometimes she overdrew her account.  \n39. Leo stopped under a streetlamp, took both her twitching hands, and said, “Then let me pay half the rent on your courage.”  \n40. She kissed him first, a quick pressing of lips that stuttered into two more kisses, mirroring her physical tics in sweet parallel.  \n41. He tasted coffee and defiance and something like starlight that refused to apologize for shining.\n\nSection 3  \n42. Months merged; they moved in together to an apartment with thin walls and generous windows.  \n43. Leo bought mugs that read “Tic-Tac-Toe Champion” and “Tourette’s & Chill,” and Mara laughed so hard she tic-slapped the counter twice.  \n44. Neighbors complained about occasional 2 a.m. vocal bursts, so Leo soundproofed the bedroom with thrift-store quilts that looked like kaleidoscope skins.  \n45. Mara started a web comic called “Tic-Talk Tina,” starring a superhero whose powers activated through involuntary sounds; Leo learned to letter the dialogue in jagged balloons that mimicked motion.  \n46. Sometimes, during intimacy, her body would jerk unexpectedly; they invented a codeword—“pause-button”—to freeze without resentment, resuming when muscles relaxed.  \n47. Leo discovered that love’s choreography could include sudden tempo changes and still arrive at tenderness.  \n48. Yet fatigue prowled their nights: Mara’s tics worsened with stress, and Leo’s freelance deadlines loomed like guillotines.  \n49. One dawn, after an hour of relentless vocal tics, Mara cried, “I’m a broken alarm clock nobody can shut off.”  \n50. Leo rocked her, whispering, “Even alarm clocks tell the truth about time.”  \n51. He googled support groups, found a candid Zoom circle, and they attended together, cameras on, hearts unarmored.  \n52. Hearing others trade stories felt like discovering a country where everyone spoke their private language.  \n53. They adopted a rescue dog with anxiety tremors; the three of them formed a symphony of unpredictable movements, paws and hands and vocal cords in overlapping cadence.  \n54. The dog learned to nuzzle Mara mid-tic, grounding her like ballast on a storm-hit boat.  \n55. Meanwhile, Leo’s father visited, gifting unsolicited advice about “medicine that could calm her down,” and Leo felt the old fear of family disapproval rear its head.  \n56. Mara, sensing tension, tic-laughed “ha-ha-ha” that morphed into real laughter, defusing the dinner table like a bomb squad of joy.  \n57. Later, in bed, Leo apologized for his father, but she placed a finger to his lips and said, “We’re not a problem to be solved; we’re a story to be read aloud.”  \n58. Financial strain tightened when Mara’s tablet—her drawing portal—died, and their savings sat in negative glow.  \n59. Leo sold his vintage guitar, the one he’d named “Seventeen” after the age he got it, felt the hollowness echo, and told no one he cried in the pawn shop.  \n60. That night Mara presented him with a new tablet, purchased with crowdfunded donations from her comic readers; she had secretly uploaded a video of Leo playing lullabies to her tics, and the internet fell in love with their duet of imperfection.  \n61. Guilt and gratitude braided inside Leo until he could barely speak; his silence said thank you in every wordless language.  \n62. She used the tablet to draw a panel of them dancing, her tics drawn as golden threads stitching the air, caption reading: “We move, therefore we are moved.”  \n63. On their first anniversary, they hosted a “Tic-Tac Picnic” in the park, inviting supporters to wear name tags declaring their own “quirks,” turning stigma into confetti.  \n64. A child approached Mara, asked if she was a puppeteer; she answered, “Yes, and the puppet is gravity itself.”  \n65. Leo photographed her as she spoke, capturing the moment her eyes held universes that refused to stand still.  \n66. That night, slow dancing in the kitchen to no music, Leo realized commitment is less a promise of perfection than a vow of perpetual translation.  \n67. He whispered, “I love the orchestra of you, even when the trumpets blare at 3 a.m.”  \n68. She responded with a vocal tic that sounded uncannily like “amore,” and they collapsed into laughter that rattled the pots hanging overhead.\n\nSection 4  \n69. Years layered like sediment; the dog grew gray, the quilts on the wall frayed, and Mara’s comic won an award for digital activism.  \n70. At the ceremony, her speech tic-interrupted itself, yet the audience leaned in, understanding the pauses were part of the melody.  \n71. Leo sat teary, recalling the bench, the folded paper, the first uncertain Tuesday that now felt prehistoric.  \n72. They traveled abroad, discovering that tics speak every language; in Tokyo a grandmother bowed to Mara as if her movements were ceremonial dance.  \n73. Jet lag magnified tics, pushing Mara into exhaustion; Leo carried her up hostel stairs, counting each step like rosary beads.  \n74. One dawn in Florence, watching sunrise paint the Arno gold, Leo asked Mara to marry him, the ring box rattling in rhythm with his anxious hand.  \n75. A vocal tic burst from her—“YES-bark!”—and the pigeons scattered like confetti thrown by the city itself.  \n76. Wedding planning became a circus of logistics: tremor-friendly cake tastings, venue staff training on Tourette’s etiquette, vows printed in large font for mid-ceremony eye-tic reading.  \n77. Leo’s father, humbled by years of tiny kindnesses, apologized in a handwritten toast that ended, “May love outrun every stigma.”  \n78. They wed beneath paper lanterns; when Mara’s vows came out in staccato bursts, the officiant waited with saintly patience, and Leo answered in matching rhythm, turning dialogue into percussion.  \n79. Their first dance choreographed included “pause-button” moments, inviting guests to freeze with them, teaching everyone that stillness can be communal.  \n80. Marriage did not solve tics, nor fatigue, nor bills, but it welded them under a shared name: “Team Tic-Tac-Go.”  \n81. They adopted a teenager, Rosa, whose foster records noted “emotional outbursts,” and for the first time Mara feared遗传 stigma like a mirror.  \n82. Rosa, however, thrived in a house where volatility was scenery, not scandal; she learned to finish Mara’s vocal tics with improvised song lyrics, turning explosions into choruses.  \n83. Leo’s mother, recovering from stroke, moved in too, bringing speech impairments that braided with Mara’s tics into a new family dialect of half-words and eloquent gestures.  \n84. Dinners became symphonies of starts and stops, laughter sometimes indistinguishable from symptom, love indistinguishable from adaptation.  \n85. Mara’s comic evolved into multimedia, projecting interactive panels where readers clicked to “hold” a tic for three seconds, donating micro-payments to neurodiversity funds; enough money poured in to launch a scholarship.  \n86. On quiet nights, Leo and Mara sat on the fire escape, city humming below them like a bassline to their slower melody.  \n87. She asked, “Ever regret the soundtrack?” pointing to her own chest.  \n88. He answered, “Regret the sky for stars?” invoking the oldest cliche with new conviction.  \n89. They grew adept at forecasting each other’s storms: certain tics preceded migraines, certain silences preceded depressive fog, certain jokes reset the weather.  \n90. Rosa graduated college with a thesis on “Atypical Movement as Performance,” citing her mothers as pioneers; Leo filmed the commencement, hands steady only because years had trained them.  \n91. The dog died at eighteen; they held a backyard funeral, inviting neighbors to share stories of acceptance learned from a trembling terrier.  \n92. Grief, they discovered, can also tic—unexpected surges of tears, laughter, and they allowed every wave.  \n93. Mara’s own tics shifted with age, softer but persistent, like a drummer favoring brushes over sticks.  \n94. Leo developed arthritis in his left hand, lending symmetry to their care: she opened jars for him; he buttoned her shirts when fingers sputtered.  \n95. They renewed vows on a subway platform, the place where commuters least expect ceremony, and strangers applauded when Mara’s vocal tic echoed “I do-do-do!” doubling emphasis.  \n96. Technology gifted them talking house lights that dimmed whenever either detected a vocal tic, turning involuntary sound into environmental response, a room that listened.  \n97. At seventy, Leo published a memoir: “Love in 4/4 Time with Interruptions”; reviewers praised its honesty, some calling it a romance, others a disability manifesto, though Leo insisted it was merely field notes on shared survival.  \n98. Mara illustrated the cover: two figures mid-dance, bodies outlined by golden dashes that looked like EKG spikes, implying heartbeats are just another form of tic.  \n99. They grew famous in niche circles, keynote speakers at global conferences, yet still fought about unwashed dishes and forgotten groceries, proving utopia is a moving target.  \n100. One winter night, power failed, city cloaked in black; they lit candles, bodies shaking with cold and age and unabated tics, and felt the old bees-sweater sensation return.  \n101. Leo recited from memory: “Even alarm clocks tell the truth about time,” and Mara finished the line with a soft vocal burst that sounded like “time-time-time,” an echo across decades.  \n102. When dawn finally filtered through frost-webbed windows, they held each other, calculating heartbeats like drummers counting in before the next unpredictable measure.  \n103. Asked once what kept them, Leo answered, “Curiosity about the next improvisation,” and Mara nodded, her nod repeating thrice, affirming past, present, future in single motion.  \n104. Their last shared public appearance was at a middle-school assembly; a girl asked if love cures tics, and Mara replied, “Love doesn’t cure; love co-authors,” voice cracking but eyes steady.  \n105. Leo squeezed her tremoring hand, sensing the即将到来的 final pause-button approaching like distant drums.  \n106. Years later, after Mara died in their bed, Leo found a note she had written during a tic-spasm but managed to steady long enough to form shaky letters: “Keep dancing when the song skips.”  \n107. He framed the note beside the original folded paper from the bus bench, two relics of punctuation that had bracketed a lifetime of commas and exclamations.  \n108. At the memorial, instead of silence, attendees were invited to move unpredictably for one minute; the resulting rustle sounded like wind through reeds, a choir of individual tics become communal hymn.  \n109. Rosa spoke last, saying, “They taught us that deviation is just another route on the same map,” and released biodegradable balloons that jerked erratically in wind, mimicking involuntary choreography.  \n110. Leo, now ancient, walked home under streetlights that flickered like old film reels, feeling Mara’s rhythm still ticking inside his chest, an internal metronome set to the tempo of enduring love.", "cost": 0.006990499999999999, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 100}], "result": true}

Civil war racked the land until Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu successively reunified the islands; Tokugawa’s victory at Sekigahara (1600) locked Japan into the isolationist *sakoku* system administered from *Edo* (today’s Tōkyō).  \n\nU.S. Commodore Matthew Perry’s *black ships* forced the country open in 1853, sparking the *Meiji* Restoration (1868) that toppled the shogun and launched rapid *industrialization*, constitutional monarchy, and imperial expansion.  Victories over China (1895) and Russia (1905) gained Taiwan, Korea, and Manchurian influence, but 1930s militarism led to World War II.

Three blown motors, one drone-shaped hole in a roof, and two investor calls that ended in “come back when it actually works” were enough.  \n\nSo we built the cloud-native physics engine we wished existed.\n\nWhat it is  \n— A browser tab. That’s it. No Linux-black-belt installs, no 200 GB of assets.  \n— 100 % GPU-accelerated, reduced-precision solver that still conserves momentum, energy, heat, charge, and your sanity.  \n— Deterministic enough for CI/CD, stochastic enough for “did we test the 3-σ wind gust?”  \n— API that slots beside Jira, GitHub, Slack, Notion, Blender, SolidWorks, ROS 2, and yes, Unreal & Unity.  \n— Parallel runs = embarrassingly parallel: 10 000 parameter sets before your coffee cools.  \n\nTranslation: you stop guessing, start knowing—before the machine shop ships metal.\n\nUse-case buffet (hot, vegetarian, and gluten-free)  \n• Swarm-robot warehouse: will the RFID gates collide when the forklifts panic-brake?  \n• VTOL commuter craft: do the props overspeed when 45 °C desert air meets 30 km/h cross-wind?  \n• Autonomous boat: how does it ride the wake of a containership without flipping?  \n• Nuclear-decommissioning manipulator: can the gantry handle 200 kg of irradiated “bombs” (actual IAEA slang for thick shielding casks) while dragging across uneven grating?

Investors want de-risked roadmaps, TikTok wants content yesterday, and “fail fast” should not equal “fail expensively.” With FluentChain you run 100 digital crashes for the price of one real one.  \n\nHow to taste  \n1. Drop your URDF, USD, SolidWorks, or even that STL you found on Thingiverse.  \n2. Tell us the environment: “lunar south-pole at dawn,” “offshore rig deck,” or simply “Earth, 30 % humidity.”  \n3. Hit “Simulate.” Watch stress plots, particle traces, heat maps—instantly.  \n4. Drag the slider: 0.1× to 10× realtime. Pause, fork, share a permalink.  \n5.

Forget the chunky dad shoes your older brother swears by; we shaved off every unnecessary gram so you can ollie, sprint, or sprint to class without feeling like you’re hauling bricks. A single shoe weighs less than your phone, yet it hides a full-length *HyperBounce™ midsole* that explodes back with 72 % energy return—basically a built-in trampoline for your feet. Translation: the more you move, the more the shoe gives back, turning last-period slump into first-place sprint.\n\nBut we know life isn’t only about speed; it’s also about stunt-worthy aesthetics. That’s why the *PulseStrike Remix* rocks a *color-shift mesh* that morphs in real life the way your favorite filter morphs on Snap. In the hallway fluorescents it’s electric violet; step outside and it flips to storm-cloud teal. No two pairs look exactly the same, because we knit every upper one at a time on programmable machines that randomize the thread layout. Translation: your best friend can buy the same model and still not bite your style.\n\nLet’s talk survival tech. The sidewalls are welded with *FlexArmor*, the same thermoplastic used in NASA rover wheels, so when your board shoots out from under you at the stairs, your shoes laugh while your knees stay intact. Inside, we slipped in *SilverFresh* odor assassins—tiny silver ions that nuke bacteria before they can turn your kicks into biohazard bins. Wear them barefoot after practice; nobody in the carpool will know.\n\nCharging your life shouldn’t stop to charge your shoes, so we skipped the glowing LEDs that die at midnight. Instead, the reflective *PulseStripe* across the heel is passive tech: hit it with a phone flash or car headlight and you turn into a walking Lite-Brite, no battery anxiety. And because we know you’re live-streaming at 1 a.m. anyway, we embedded a NFC tag under the tongue; tap it with any Android or iPhone and it auto-launches a playlist curated by rising lo-fi producers who actually answer their DMs.\n\nFinally, we kept the planet in mind while we cooked this color-shifting beast.

But one Tuesday the universe delivered a soggy, shoe-stealing Labrador named Pickle who could open the fridge with his nose. Within a week, Harry’s socks had become endangered species and his couch looked like it had been through a wood chipper. Determined to civilize the beast, Harry enrolled them both in “Polite Paws & Their Clueless Humans” night class, proudly marking the calendar in red pen: “Day One of New Order.”\n\nSECTION 2  \nAt class, the instructor commanded, “Heel!” Harry stepped forward; Pickle pirouetted, snatched the trainer’s clipboard, and sprinted out the doggy door. Harry gave chase, shouting apologies and threats in equal measure: “Drop the evidence, you furry hooligan!” Pickle led him on a leash-tangled tour of the strip mall—through a yoga studio (“Downward Dog is NOT instructions!”), past a taco stand (Pickle inhaled four tacos, wrappers and all), and finally into the automatic car wash where both man and beast emerged lemon-scented and foam-flecked. The class, now soggy spectators, awarded Harry the gold star for “Most Unintentional Entertainment.”\n\nSECTION 3  \nBack home, Harry flopped on the shredded couch. Pickle, apparently remorseful, dropped the clipboard—now autographed by everyone in class—as well as a half-eaten taco in Harry’s lap. Harry sighed, “Thanks, I was starving.” Pickle wagged, banged his tail against the lamp, and the bulb popped, plunging the room into soft, forgiving darkness. In that peaceful blackout, Harry scratched Pickle’s ears and muttered, “You know, life with you is chaos, but at least my laundry budget doubles as an cardio program.” Pickle responded by belching lemon foam and resting his head on Harry’s knee, utterly convinced he’d just graduated summa cum laude. Harry decided to cancel the rest of the obedience course; apparently, they already understood each other perfectly—one made disasters, the other made lemonade (or at least lemon-scented towels).

After a bar brawl, he’s sentenced to court-ordered sleep studies for anger management. In the lab he meets Dr. Lila Myles, a neuroscientist experimenting with “lucid-link” tech: a headset that lets her enter a subject’s dream in real time. During Dante’s first session a power surge flings him into the subconscious of another patient—an 8-year-old boy whose nightmares manifest as a faceless, charcoal-skinned giant. Instinct kicks in; Dante lands a perfect left hook… and the monster explodes into black sand. The child wakes cured. Lila realizes Dante is the first recorded “oneirolog”: a human who retains superhuman strength inside dreams. The catch: every punch he throws in the dream-world bruises his real body.\n\nACT II – THE UNDERGROUND R.E.M.  \nWord leaks. A clandestine fight circuit called R.E.M. (Recreational Extreme Metasomnia) run by billionaire insomniac Sterling Voss kidnaps Dante and forces him to battle for gamblers who bet on dream combat. Inside the collective unconscious, fighters manifest powers limited only by imagination: a Shaolin monk who grows six spectral arms, a spoken-word poet whose metaphors become fire-breathing dragons. Dante refuses to kill, so Voss straps Lila into the lucid-link as collateral. To keep her safe, Dante must climb the bracket. Each victory tears new ligaments in the waking world; his hands swell like boxing gloves filled with broken glass. Meanwhile the boy he saved begins drawing charcoal giants again—bigger, smarter. The nightmares are adapting, feeding on the violence Dante keeps feeding them.\n\nACT III – WAKE OR DIE  \nIn the championship bout, Voss injects the entire audience with micro-doses of the lucid-link serum, turning the city’s sleep into one coliseum. The final opponent is Dante’s own doppelgänger—his rage given shape, wearing the UFC belt he never lost. While millions sleep, the city skyline flickers between daylight and dream-darkness; buildings melt into punching bags, neon signs become ring ropes. If dream-Dante loses, the doppelgänger will step through the veil and possess his body, making the dream-state permanent.  \nDante realizes he can’t win by fighting. Instead he lets the rage-phantom pummel him, absorbing every blow until the creature’s hands begin to mirror his real fractures. When the double screams in pain, Dante hugs it—an embrace that dissolves the monster into the black sand of every fear he’s ever fed.  \nThe audience wakes to find every bruise on their own bodies—matching Dante’s—then watches those bruises fade as forgiveness replaces blood-lust. Voss, now comatose, is trapped inside his own endless nightmare where he can never sleep again.  \nLila helps Dante remove the headset for the last time. His hands are forever ruined for MMA, but children citywide hang crayon drawings of a faceless guardian made of sand who hugs monsters until they disappear. Dante opens a small gym where he teaches kids to fight their nightmares with paper and breath instead of fists—because the greatest superpower, he tells them, is deciding which dreams you refuse to feed.", "cost": 0.0015704999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Just as our founding fathers envisioned a nation where freedom reigns, so too does this fundamental principle ensure that no process, no transformation, occurs without accounting for the true cost of change. In chemistry, as in democracy, nothing comes without a price, and Gibbs free energy is the ultimate accountant of our thermodynamic economy, measuring what can be done versus what must be paid.\n\nIt represents the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at constant temperature and pressure, a beacon of predictability in a world of chaos. When ΔG is negative, reactions proceed as surely as our commitment to progress; when positive, they resist change like entrenched special interests. This is not merely academic—this is the difference between a battery that powers our clean energy future and one that fails in your child's toy, between a drug that saves lives and a compound that remains forever theoretical. The equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS tells us that spontaneity requires not just favorable enthalpy, but also the courage to embrace entropy's inevitable increase.\n\nWe must understand that Gibbs free energy doesn't just describe test tubes and beakers—it governs the combustion in our engines, the metabolism in our cells, the very photosynthesis that converts sunlight into the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat. Every politician who promises revolutionary change without accounting for energy costs, every CEO who dreams of perpetual motion profits, every citizen who demands solutions without sacrifice—they must all confront this fundamental law. For in the end, nature cannot be lobbied, cannot beFilleted with misleading advertisements, cannot be overturned by executive order.\n\nSo I say to you tonight: let us commit ourselves to understanding this principle, to teaching it in every classroom, to applying it in every laboratory and factory. Let us remember that true freedom—the freedom to innovate, to create, to build a better tomorrow—comes not from ignoring constraints but from mastering them. Just as our democracy works best when we understand its mechanisms, so too will our technological future shine brightest when we respect Gibbs free energy as the ultimate boundary condition of possibility.

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "response": "9 Unexpected Dutch Language Facts That Will Make You Say “Wat?!”\n\nThe Dutch language is spoken by more than 23 million people worldwide, yet it hides linguistic quirks that even seasoned polyglots rarely suspect. Below are nine bite-size facts that prove Nederlands is anything but “just German with a funny accent.”\n\n1. The longest word is 53 letters (and it’s official)\nMeervoetstapparticipatieverzekeringspolis­voorwaarden­beschrijvings­papier—yes, that’s one word—means “multiple-step participatory insurance policy condition description paper.” Dutch allows almost unlimited noun stacking, so hyphen-less monsters like this are legal government vocabulary, not carnival stunts.\n\n2. False friends can get you fired\nIf your Dutch boss asks for a “monster,” don’t call HR—*a monster is simply a sample.* Order a “kunt” (can) at the hardware store and you’ll sound ancient but polite. Say “ik wil je even neuken,” intending “I need to bump (your car),” and you’ve accidentally announced that you want to… well, let’s just say HR will definitely be involved.\n\n3. Dutch is older than Modern English\nThe earliest continuous Dutch sentence—“Hebban olla vogala nestas hagunnan hinase hi(c) anda thu”—was scribbled in 1100, two centuries before Chaucer. *That lovers’ lament (“Have all birds begun nests except me and you”) still scans to modern ears once you swap consonants.*\n\n4. It has only one gender: common\nStandard Dutch collapsed masculine and feminine into a single “common” gender, leaving neuter as the only other option. Still, about 75% of nouns are “de” words, so learners fight a lifelong statistical battle to remember “het” koffie and “het” huis.\n\n5. Question verbs go where?!\nSubordinate-clause word order flips the verb to the end. Compare:\n• English: “I think (that) she is happy.”\n• Dutch: *“Ik denk dat ze blij is.”* (Literally: “I think that she happy is.”)\n\n6. A single letter can be a complete word\n“’s ochtends” (in the morning) starts with an apostrophe just so the archaic genitive marker can stay alive. Even weirder, “u” means “you” (formal), while “uu” is rare onomatopoeia for a pigeon’s coo.\n\n7. Diminutives are huge\nAdding –tje, –je, or –pje lets you shrink anything:\n• huis (house) → huisje (tiny house)\n• baby → baby’tje (tiny baby—yes, the Dutch miniaturize what’s already small)\nAbout 1,500 everyday nouns exist primarily in their diminutive form; ask for “biertje” and no one ever hands you a full-size “beer.”\n\n8. You already know thousands of Dutch words\nEnglish and Dutch share Low-German roots. Sailors left linguistic DNA: yacht, dock, boom, pump, skipper, keelhauling. Meanwhile Dutch traders gifted cookie, waffle, brandy, easel, sketch, landscape—and of course “Dutch treat,” a phrase the Dutch themselves never use.\n\n9. Dutch dialects are mutually unintelligible\nHolland city folk giggle at Limburg farmers, whose dialects add French yodels and German diphthongs.

Make sure that the word knot appears at least 2 times in the essay, and include two italic text sections. Like: *this is italic text*", "response": "Wilderness preservation is not a luxury for weekend hikers or romantic poets; it is an ecological and ethical necessity that tethers our technological civilization to the planet’s original operating instructions. When we speak of wilderness, we are not merely talking about scenery or recreation; we are referring to the living knot of relationships that precedes human history and will outlast our civilizations if we allow it to remain intact. The decision to leave land untrammeled is therefore less an act of generosity than an act of recognition: we acknowledge that other species, watersheds, and atmospheric processes have an inalienable right to exist in their own tangled knot of evolution, unfurled by the demands of quarterly earnings or electoral cycles.\n\n*The quiet respiration of intact forests, the slow crumble of granite under frost, the choreography of wolves and elk across ridgelines—these phenomena do not require human witnesses to be meaningful, yet human witnesses require them to remain sane.* In the absence of such reference points, culture collapses into a hall of mirrors where the only measurable value is utility. Wilderness preservation, then, is a deliberate refusal to commodify every last acre. It is a boundary drawn against the imperialism of extractive logic, a declaration that some places will be spared the conversion of living beings into cash.\n\nOpponents of preservation often argue that locking away resources is economically irresponsible. They tally board-feet of timber, ounces of gold, or barrels of oil and declare the “highest use” of land to be its immediate consumption. Yet this calculus is artificially narrow. It omits the externality of biodiversity loss, the insurance value of intact watersheds, and the psychological dividend of knowing that unscripted landscapes still exist. A single acre of old-growth forest can filter more water than a municipal treatment plant, sequester carbon at a fraction of the cost of engineered scrubbers, and host pollinators that fertilize nearby farms. The economic question, therefore, is not whether preservation costs too much, but whether destruction costs even more—only the invoice is delivered later and addressed to our children.\n\nThe political battle for wilderness is inseparable from the cultural battle for imagination. When children grow up identifying more corporate logos than native plants, they become citizens who cannot envision a world whose purpose is not consumption. Conversely, a teenager who has watched dawn rearrange the colors of a high mountain basin carries inside her an internal map that can guide future policy. *Experiential memory is the antidote to the manufactured consensus that there is no alternative to growth*. Every preserved landscape is therefore a library whose holdings exceed the digitized archives of any university; its texts are written in lichen grammar, glacial moraines, and the seasonal grammar of migration.\n\nCritics sometimes contend that wilderness designation is a form of colonialism itself—an imposition of euro-American ideals on landscapes previously shaped by Indigenous fire regimes, hunting grounds, and seasonal camps. This critique contains truth, but it need not lead to paralysis. Collaborative management agreements, co-stewardship contracts, and the return of ancestral lands to tribal nations are all methods by which preservation can be decoupled from exclusion. The goal is not to freeze ecosystems in some imaginary, pre-contact stasis, but to allow them to continue evolving without the bulldozer’s rupture. Indigenous knowledge, informed by millennia of observation, can help untie the false knot between human presence and ecological degradation; it reminds us that people can be cultivators of abundance rather than miners of depletion.\n\nUltimately, wilderness preservation is an exercise in temporal humility. It concedes that the present generation is neither the author nor the finale of Earth’s story. When we safeguard roadless valleys or marine sanctuaries, we are not doing nature a favor; we are acknowledging that favor was done for us by the photosynthetic labor of algae, the sedimentary patience of limestone, and the climatic diplomacy of oceans. To keep a single river wild is to keep faith with a planetary script older than any scripture. In doing so, we loosen the lethal knot of hubris that assumes tomorrow must automatically belong to us. It may, but only if we consent to share the stage with the ten million other actors who never auditioned for our approval—and who, by their very existence, still approve of us.", "cost": 0.0017755000000000002, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "knot", "frequency": 2}, {"num_highlights": 2}], "result": true}

Problem  \n   Political campaigns, local businesses, churches, HOAs, gig-economy side-hustlers, and simply curious humans all need to reach “likely-receptive” strangers inside a geographic polygon.  \n   Today they:  \n   • Buy shady voter/consumer lists (outdated, 20 % bounce).  \n   • Door-knock (labor $28/hr, 6 % conversion, safety issues).  \n   • Geo-fenced digital ads (38 % ad-block, 2 % click-through).  \n   No turnkey, privacy-compliant way to send a physical letter at census-block precision.\n\n4.

His experience in Muslim prisons later shaped his cautious approach to warfare and diplomacy. After his release he married Eschiva of Bures and controlled extensive lands in Galilee. He supported the claim of Baldwin IV during the royal succession crisis despite being a potential rival himself. When Baldwin revealed he had leprosy Raymond served as regent and tried to balance factions in the kingdom. He led the army at the Battle of Marj Ayyun in 1179 where he was defeated and captured again by Saladin. After a second ransom he returned to find the kingdom increasingly divided between his moderate faction and the aggressive party led by Guy of Lusignan and Raynald of Chatillon.\n\n*Early life* was shaped by tragedy and upheaval that forced him into leadership while still a boy. *Captivity and release* taught him respect for Muslim power and patience in diplomacy. *Regency and political struggles* showed his desire to keep peace even when it cost him popularity among hawkish nobles.\n\nFollowing the death of Baldwin IV Raymond briefly lost influence yet stayed central to politics. He refused to be crowned king but accepted reappointment as regent for Sibylla’s son. After the disaster at Hattin in 1187 he helped organize defense of Tyre and acted as guardian to the young heir. His death in 1187 from wounds or illness ended his career as the last major moderate leader in the crusader states.

I am writing to extend a warm invitation to each of you for an important strategic alignment meeting that will take place on Thursday June 27 at 10 AM in the Riverside Conference Hall on the third floor of the Innovation Tower. The purpose of this gathering is to explore the deep connections that exist between our current projects and to discuss how these connections are correlated with the broader objectives we have set for the second half of the year. We believe that by coming together in one room we can strengthen our shared vision and create a unified path forward that benefits every team and every stakeholder that we serve.\n\nDuring the past quarter many of us have been experiencing rapid changes in market conditions technological capabilities and client expectations. These shifts are not isolated events but rather interconnected developments that demand a coordinated response. The meeting will offer a structured yet open environment where we can review fresh data share firsthand observations and identify which trends are most strongly correlated with our key performance indicators. Our goal is to transform isolated experiences into collective wisdom so that every department can leave with actionable insights that will drive meaningful progress throughout the summer months and beyond.\n\nThe agenda has been designed to balance strategic overview with practical detail. We will begin with a concise presentation from the analytics group that highlights which customer behaviors are most strongly correlated with long term loyalty. After that we will break into rotating discussion circles so that everyone has the chance to speak about the challenges they are experiencing and to offer solutions that others might adapt. A light networking breakfast will be available starting at 9 30 AM and a catered lunch will follow the formal sessions so that informal conversations can continue in a relaxed setting. We encourage you to arrive early mingle with colleagues you have not seen in person for a while and share stories about the creative ways you are experiencing success on the ground.\n\nPlease confirm your attendance by replying to this message no later than Friday June 21 so that we can finalize catering numbers and prepare personalized resource packets. In your reply let us know if you have any dietary requirements accessibility needs or specific topics you would like the facilitators to address. We will do our best to accommodate every request because we want every participant to feel fully supported throughout the day. If you are unable to attend in person we will provide a secure live stream link and a post event recording however we strongly encourage physical presence so that you can engage in the spontaneous brainstorming that often occurs during hallway conversations and coffee breaks.\n\nRemember that the insights we generate together are correlated with measurable outcomes such as client satisfaction scores product adoption rates and revenue growth. Every story you share about a challenge you are experiencing could become the seed of an innovation that another team adapts and scales. Your voice is vital to the ecosystem we are cultivating and we do not want to move forward without the perspective that only you can provide.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you on Thursday June 27 for what promises to be an energizing and productive day. Please mark your calendar block the morning and early afternoon and prepare to leave with new connections renewed purpose and a clear set of next steps. If you have any questions before the meeting do not hesitate to reach out to me directly or to contact our event coordinator Maya Patel whose details are listed below. Together we can transform individual experiences into collective momentum and ensure that the second half of the year is our strongest yet.\n\nThank you for your commitment to collaboration and innovation. See you soon in the Riverside Conference Hall where great ideas meet great people and where the future of our shared mission begins to take shape.\n\nWith appreciation and anticipation\n\nJordan Lee\nStrategic Initiatives Director\nInnovation Tower 3rd Floor\njordan.lee@company.org\nExtension 8842", "cost": 0.001591, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence", "length_constraints:number_words", "punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["correlated", "experiencing"]}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 500}, {}], "result": true}
{"id": 1072, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post with 400 or more words about the benefits of sleeping in a hammock.", "response": "Sleep Like a Leaf: Seven Science-Backed Reasons to Spend the Night in a Hammock\n\nMost people think of hammocks as vacation novelties—colorful cocoons that appear between palm trees for an afternoon siesta and then disappear with the Instagram story. Yet a growing tribe of converts is discovering that the best sleep of their lives happens when they stay suspended long after sunset. From thru-hikers on the Appalachian Trail to minimalist millennials in studio apartments, overnight hammock sleeping is moving from eccentric to essential. Below are seven evidence-based perks you can expect when you trade the box spring for a gentle sway.\n\n1. Deeper, Faster, Longer REM  \nUniversity of Geneva neuroscientists found that gentle rocking shortens sleep-latency—the time it takes to drift off—and increases the duration of stage N2 and N3 non-REM sleep, the phases most closely tied to tissue repair and immune function. In the study, participants napped in custom rockers; hammock sleepers replicate that same micro-movement naturally, so every breeze or breath becomes a lullaby that guides the brain into slow-wave territory.\n\n2. Zero-Pressure-Point Anatomy  \nA mattress, no matter how plush, creates contact peaks at the shoulders, hips and heels. Over eight hours these hotspots compress capillaries, prompting the body to roll over 30–40 times a night. A well-hung hammock distributes weight evenly along the body’s longitudinal axis, eliminating those pressure spikes. Less micro-arousal equals less tossing, turning and blanket origami, so you wake up without the familiar “dead-arm” phenomenon.\n\n3. Natural Spinal Alignment  \nWhen rigged with a 30-degree sag (think banana, not newspapers-in-a-string), a hammock molds to the contours of the spine instead of forcing the spine to flatten itself to the bed. Lumbar and cervical gaps fill automatically, giving side- and back-sleepers the orthopedic benefits of a $4,000 adjustable base for the price of two carabiners.\n\n4. Breathing Room for the Lungs  \nSleeping flat on the back allows gravity to push the tongue and soft palate backward, a chief trigger for snoring and apnea episodes. The slight incline created by a hammock’s shoulder squeeze keeps the airway open, cutting incidence of snoring by up to 50 % in small Swiss clinic trials. Partners report fewer nighttime pokes, and solo sleepers log better blood-oxygen saturation on fitness trackers.\n\n5. Cooler Core, Hotter Metabolism  \nHammocks are essentially air beds. Convection currents whisk away body heat, keeping skin temperature in the comfort zone without the arctic blast of a fan. Meanwhile brown-fat cells—those metabolic furnaces—must work harder to maintain core temp, resulting in a mild caloric after-burn similar to cold-exposure therapy. A 2022 Japanese study estimates an extra 150–200 calories torched per night, the equivalent of a 30-minute walk.\n\n6. Allergen-Free Microclimate  \nMattresses double in weight over ten years thanks to dust-mite droppings, fungal spores and skin flakes. A hammock’s nylon or cotton fabric can be popped in the washer or hung in UV light, annihilating mites in minutes. Asthma sufferers often report clearer sinuses within a week of switching, a benefit the New Zealand Asthma Foundation now formally endorses.\n\n7. Planetary & Pocketbook Light Footprint  \nA quality hammock system costs under $200, uses zero petroleum-based foams, and when paired with tree straps leaves no trace. Compare that to the 20-million mattresses discarded annually in the U.S. alone, each one a mini landfill iceberg persisting for 90–120 years.\n\nReady to hover? Start indoors: anchor straps into ceiling joists or a purpose-built stand, lie diagonally to flatten the torso, add an under-quilt for chilly nights, and let your circadian rhythm recalibrate to gentle sway instead of static steel coils. You may find, like thousands of converts, that the best mattress is no mattress at all—just you, a ripple of fabric, and eight hours of weightless, frictionless, dream-rich sleep.", "cost": 0.001736, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 400}], "result": true}

Make sure to use the word war at least 8 times, and the word peace at least 10 times.", "response": "When the Tang dynasty (618-907) held power, China experienced cycles of war and peace that reshaped Asia. The dynasty itself was born from war: after years of civil war against the Sui, Li Yuan declared peace in 618 by founding the Tang. Yet peace was short-lived, for war soon flared on the northern frontier. The early Tang fought war after war against the Eastern Turks, ultimately forcing those steppe riders to accept peace and become vassals.\n\nDuring the reign of Taizong (626-649), the court combined hard war with clever diplomacy. Taizong waged war in Central Asia, but he also offered peace to defeated tribes, earning him the title “Heavenly Khan.” His mixture of war and peace doubled the empire’s size and sent Silk Road profits flowing toward Chang’an. For common farmers, peace meant tax breaks, while war meant conscription; the balance between war and peace decided whether villages thrived or starved.\n\nThe mid-Tang period saw the unprecedented An Lushan war (755-763), a cataclysm that shattered the illusion of eternal peace. Rebel armies swept the north, and the emperor had to promise peace to any regional warlord who would fight for the throne. After that war, the dynasty never fully regained central control; instead, a patchwork of local peace treaties replaced one empire-wide peace. Border war with Tibet, Nanzhao, and the Abbasids continued, but within each province a brittle peace allowed markets to stay open.\n\nDespite chronic war on the edges, Chang’an and Luoyang became megacities where poets sang of peace. Du Fu wrote of the grief bred by war, while Li Bai toasted the mirage of perpetual peace. Buddhist monks, protected by imperial peace edicts, translated sutras in monasteries that war had never touched. When war finally reached the capital in 881—the Huang Chao rebellion—citizens fled, remembering how fleeting peace can be.\n\nBy the late 800s, the Tang court was financing war through salt taxes, but could no longer buy peace from mutinous generals. Zhu Wen, once a rebel who had demanded peace terms, ended the dynasty in 907 by forcing the last boy-emperor to abdicate, replacing imperial peace with the chaos of the Five Dynasties. In sum, the Tang era proved that even the most celebrated peace rests on war’s uneasy shoulders, and that every promise of peace can, under the drumbeat of war, dissolve like morning mist over the Wei River.", "cost": 0.00107, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "war", "frequency": 8}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "peace", "frequency": 10}], "result": true}

Make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotes and use at least 800 words.", "response": "\"At the end of the nineteenth century the feelings toward the Habsburg Empire in what Croats called the Triune Kingdom and in the lands Serbs considered their southern Austrian borderlands were not a single chord but a tangle of counter-melodies.  Every district, every confession, every newspaper office hummed with its own variation, yet four large motifs can be distinguished: dynastic loyalty, constitutional impatience, South-Slav exhilaration, and the steady percussion of social resentment.\n\n1.  Dynastic loyalty: the emperor as shield\nFor many Croatian peasants and townsmen the question was still personal, not abstract.  When an imperial regiment in green-grey coats marched through Zagreb in 1892 the crowd uncovered its heads and the band played “Gott erhalte.”  Older gentry remembered 1849, when Ban Jelačić’s cavalry had saved Vienna from the Hungarian revolution; they told their children that the crown had in return saved Croatia from Magyarization.  In the Serbian villages of the Military Frontier, demobilized Grenzer still wore their brass medals bearing the double eagle; priests in Sremski Karlovci preached that Franz Joseph was “the Orthodox tsar in the West,” the last barrier against the oppression they expected from Constantinople or later from Belgrade.  School primers in both languages praised the emperor’s paternal justice, and when cholera struck Osijek in 1893 the arrival of imperial doctors and flour convoys seemed to prove the point.  Even the critics rarely attacked the person of the monarch; their anger was directed at “Budapest sharks,” “Vienna bankers,” or “the bureaucracy,” never at “His Apostolic Majesty.”  This habit of loyal grievance—of asking the ruler to rescue his subjects from his own ministers—was inherited from earlier centuries and still coloured petitions, Sunday sermons and banqueting toasts.\n\n2.  Constitutional impatience: Croat and Serb versions\nCroatian politicians, however, had moved beyond gratitude.  The Nagodba of 1868 had given Croatia domestic autonomy, a sabornik (diet) and a ban, but it had not delivered the hoped-for reunion with Dalmatia and, more painfully, had left financial, railway and educational policy in Budapest’s hands.  By 1895 the young Party of Right, led by the lawyer Ante Starčević until his death in 1896, was turning the yearly anniversary of the battle at Krbava field (1493) into a demonstration that Croatia had never voluntarily accepted Hungarian lordship.  Their newspapers printed maps showing “the state right” extending to the Drina and the Adriatic; crowds shouted “Živu nam naš—“ (Long live ours!) a deliberately ambiguous slogan meaning either an autonomous Croatia or a future Yugoslavia.  Parallel to them, the Croat-Serb Coalition formed in 1905 but rehearsing its arguments already in the 1890s, insisted that Vienna must be persuaded to recognise South Slav unity inside the empire, not outside it.  Their leader, the Serb merchant Frano Supilo, told the Zagreb town council in 1899 that “either Austria will become a federation of peoples or we shall become her grave-diggers.”  Thus even the most strident Croat voices still negotiated within imperial institutions; they wanted a better contract, not a divorce.\n\nSerbian elites in Vojvodina and Bosnia approached the same institutions from a narrower ledge.  The great migration of 1690 had left them with cultural autonomy—an archbishop at Karlovci, a separate church-school council, the right to elect their own prefects—but no territorial assembly.  Every attempt to create a Serbian voivodeship inside southern Hungary had been vetoed in Budapest.  Hence their rhetoric was defensive: protect what we have, enlarge it if possible.  The newspaper “Zastava” in Novi Sad warned in 1897 that Magyar county officials were replacing Cyrillic signs with Latin ones; it begged Vienna to enforce the 1868 Nationalities Law more strictly.  When Franz Joseph visited Belgrade in 1896 he was cheered by Semlin (Zemun) Serbs who waved both the black-yellow and the Serbian tricolour; they wanted the emperor to know that their loyalty was conditional on protection from Magyar assimilation.  In this way Serb leaders mirrored Croat tactics, but their imagined safety zone was smaller: a cultural nation, not a historic state.\n\n3.  South-Slav exhilaration: the Yugoslav idea on the Danube\nUrban youth, reading newspapers smuggled from Belgrade and Zagreb university halls, were already impatient with both double loyalty and ethnic jealousy.  To them Austria felt like a giant lobster trap: rich bait, iron wires.  They spoke of “naš Jugo-Slavija” (our Yugoslavia) long before the word appeared in diplomatic cables.  In Zagreb the student society “Slavenska Jugo” (1894) toasted the day when Slovenes, Croats and Serbs would share one parliament; their manifesto claimed the Adriatic as “our Mediterranean” and the Danube as “our Mississippi.”  Serbian students from Sombor, Novi Sad and Banja Luka answered with gatherings in Sremski Karlovci where Orthodox seminarians sang “Bože pravde” followed by Austrian student songs.  These circles were small—perhaps five thousand people in 1900—but they set the emotional temperature for the coming decades.  Their journals—„Srpski književni glasnik“, „Hrvatski dnevnik“, the satirical weekly „Duje“—ridiculed the provincial bickering of their elders and printed maps that coloured Slovenia, Croatia-Slavonia, Dalmatia, Bosnia, Vojvodina and Serbia in a single wash of purple.  The authorities watched them uneasily: the Zagrovje provincial police reported that every third copy of „Narodna odbrana“ (printed in Belgrade but shipped across the Sava) was bought by Jewish or German shopkeepers who then passed it on to Croat clerks.  Thus the idea of Yugoslavia seeped across confessional and class lines, making Austria look obsolete rather than oppressive.\n\n4.  The percussion of social grievance: peasants, workers and the borderlands\nFeelings toward Vienna also depended on how close one lived to the tax collector.  In the Croatian Zagorje, wine growers cursed the imperial tobacco monopoly that forced them to sell grapes at fixed prices; in Slavonian Srijem the same peasants blessed the imperial credit union that saved them from Magyar usurers.  Serbian share-croppers in southern Hungary blamed Magyar landlords for takings two-thirds of the wheat, but they addressed their complaints to the emperor’s military frontier legacy that had once promised them freehold plots.  Miners in Bosnia, newly annexed (1878, constitutionally 1908) but already worked by imperial investors, cursed the fourteen-hour shifts yet boasted that “the emperor’s steam” drove the pumps that kept them alive after underground fires.  Railway navvies—Catholic Bunjevci from Subotica, Orthodox Serbs from Lika, Muslim labourers from Sarajevo—drank together in sidings where they learned each other’s curses and shared the conviction that Vienna took the profits while Budapest took the glory.  Their songs, half-illegible in police files, alternated between nostalgic regret for “old military pay” and angry jokes about “the kaiser who eats our bread with two mustaches.”  Thus the empire appeared simultaneously as distant patriarch and local exploiter, a contradiction that no nationalist speech needed to invent.\n\nReligion, commerce and migration completed the mosaic.  Franciscan friars in Herzegovina collected money for a new basilia at Marija Bistrica but also petitioned Vienna to prevent Orthodox icon processions from passing through their villages: their sentiment was Catholic solidarity against the schismatic neighbour rather than against the emperor.  Serb wholesalers in Osijek donated a new organ for the metropolitan church yet cursed Austrian tariff walls that forced them to buy Tyrolean glass at 30% duty while Belgrade offered it cheaper.  Between 1890 and 1900 roughly 120,000 people from the Habsburg South Slav lands emigrated to the United States; letters printed in the weekly “Amerikanski Srbobran” told those left behind that “even under McKinley we pay no bishop’s tax,” a phrase that quietly undermined both Croatian and Serbian clerical loyalty.  Steamship agencies in Rijeka and Zemun advertised passages with posters showing Uncle Sam shaking hands with a peasant who drops the double-eagle hat into the sea.  Each such departure bled away a family’s readiness to defend the empire and fed stories that life might be better outside the Danubian cage.\n\nBy 1900, then, one could travel one hundred kilometres across the Croatian-Slavonian plain and hear four contrasting verdicts on Austria.  In a Zagreb coffeehouse a university student declared that “the empire is our finishing school; we learn German law to destroy it.”  In a Karlovac village an elderly Grenzer told his grandchildren that “the kaiser’s bones hold our roof above the Ungar (Hungarian) storm.”  In a Vojvodina wheat field a Serbian tenant invoked the emperor to restrain the “pasha in Budapest,” while in a Sarajevo tavern a Muslim imam and a Franciscan priest toasted “the house of Habsburg—because only it stands between us and the greedy prince in Belgrade.”  None of these sentiments was fixed; they shaded into one another like colours on a Balkan rug.  What they shared was a conviction that the future would not be settled in Vienna’s ballrooms but in the muddy fields and printing shops where Croat and Serb voices—sometimes separate, increasingly entwined—were rehearsing the claim that they, not the emperor, would decide what South Slav destiny meant.  The empire still stood, but loyalty had become negotiable, a currency whose value dropped with every new Magyar tax decree, every closed Adriatic harbour, every arrested student who shouted, not yet “Down with Austria,” but already “Long live our nation—somewhere, somehow, soon.”\"", "cost": 0.004383000000000001, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 800}], "result": true}

In 1989 a British dude named Tim drops the World Wide Web: suddenly pages have pictures, fonts, and the first «click here» button. The internet gets a facelift.\n\n3. Dial-up & the «get off the phone, I need Instagram—wait, never mind» era (1990s)  \nThat screechy modem sound? That’s your 1996 mixtape. Pages load like sloths on vacation, but we still crowd around the family PC to Ask Jeeves random stuff for homework. Chat rooms = first taste of talking to strangers without leaving your bedroom.\n\n4. Broadband, Wi-Fi, and the rise of the hoodie (2000s)  \nNo more wires, no more sister yelling about the phone line. YouTube (2005) turns everyone into a director; Facebook escapes from college dorms (2006) and suddenly your parents can «like» your pics. Brutal.\n\n5. Phones swallow the internet (2010-now)  \n4G + iPhones = pocket-sized universe. Memes, TikTok dances, Snap streaks—life measured in Wi-Fi bars. Average teen today swaps 150+ texts a day, streams 2 hrs of video, and accidentally learns quantum physics from a 60-sec explainer. Brain = infinite tabs.\n\n🚀 5 ways the internet hacked your life (good & bad)\n\n1. Homework superpowers  \nDidn’t read The Great Gatsby? Shmoop, CrashCourse, and SparkNotes got you. Teachers know, but they also binge Netflix—balanced karma.\n\n2. Zero–distance friendships  \nGroup chat at 2 a.m. with friends three time-zones away = global slumber party. Just remember: if they’re only the «laugh» emoji, still counts as socializing (sorta).\n\n3. Fame for free  \nOne viral clip and you’re the main character. Downside: tomorrow the internet forgets you for a dancing corgi.\n\n4. Mental–health check  \nAccess to support forums, therapy apps, crisis text lines—literally lifesaving. But doomscrolling at 3 a.m. steals sleep; blue-light life is a shady frenemy.\n\n5.

Your eyes will thank you when you’re 30 and still want to read memes without bifocals.  \n– Password mythbuster: «ilovepizza123» isn’t unique, even if you really, REALLY love pizza.  \n– Digital footprints last longer than Snapchat streaks—future you (and future college admissions) can see.  \n– Learn to unplug: airplane-mode your phone for one hour a day.

The grammar of leaves  \nLook closer: the adult leaf is a sabre of matte grey-green,  \nbut the sapling’s are still round, opal, and innocent—  \nthe tree speaking in two tenses at once.  \nThey hang opposite, yet spiral in prayer,  \na living palimpsest of adaptation.  \nWhen wind argumentatively passes,  \nthey do not merely shake; they exhale,  \nreleasing a cool blue grammar that even fire respects,  \nfor the oils that protect them also warn  \nflame to tiptoe, to crackle elsewhere.  \n\nIII.  Koala scripture  \nHigh up, grey fur against grey bark,  \na koala is a comma in the long sentence of the trunk,  \npausing digestion to dream of cyanide-sweet cellulose.  \nThe eucalypt feeds its predator with the same patience  \na mother shows a restless child—  \nhere, toxin is also gift, and sleep is the price of supper.  \n\nIV.  Human harvest  \nWe came with saws and still-ink patents,  \nfound in its straightness masts for clippers,  \nin its density railway sleepers that never beg for rest.  \nWe steam-distilled the leaves to a clarion oil  \nthat can unblock a child’s midnight wheeze,  \ndisinfect a sailor’s cut, perfume a Victorian handkerchief,  \nor—dripped on a hot rock—turn a sauna into a Nordic cathedral.  \nWe ground its pulp to paper  \nso that love letters and parking tickets might share  \nthe same ghost of a ghost gum.  \n\nV.  The apiarist’s secret  \nBeekeepers set their hives beneath flowering eucs  \nand the bees return, drunken on crystalline possibility,  \nspinning a honey so pale it is the colour of first light,  \nso fragrant that spoons remember entire forests.  \nOne teaspoon on winter toast  \nand the kitchen window opens itself to summer.  \n\nVI.  Hydraulic poem  \nIn the Language of Dry Continents,  \nthe eucalypt is a verb meaning  \n“I will send my roots down farther than your drought.”  \nIt mines the underground rivers,  \npumps water upward like a green heart,  \nthen bleeds scented resin to seal its own wounds,  \nteaching the arid earth the art of self-surgery.  \n\nVII.  Fire, friend, foe  \nWhen the burning day finally arrives,  \nthe oils flash, a quick blue shout,  \nand the canopy explodes into galaxies of ember.  \nYet beneath the blackened sleeve of bark,  \nepicormic buds have already rehearsed resurrection;  \nwithin weeks, lime-green spears perforate the scorched sleeve,  \nand the tree becomes its own phoenix,  \na living match that strikes itself alight  \nonly to rekindle its own green flame.  \n\nVIII.

Arithmetic of oxygen  \nOne mature tree, botanists calculate,  \nexhales enough pure oxygen each day  \nfor a family of four to survive another twenty-four hours.  \nMultiply by forest, by continent, by hemisphere,  \nand the eucalypt becomes a worldwide lung,  \na public service paid in silence,  \nits invoice written in the invisible ink of continued living.  \n\nX.

{"id": 1258, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "I have a dime. What can I do with this dime? Give me advice in the style of a President of the United States and make sure it has at least 600 words.", "response": "My Fellow American,\n\nI rise before you today—not in the marbled grandeur of the Capitol, not beneath the floodlights of a stadium, but in the quiet company of a single coin. Ten cents. One planchet of cupronickel, slightly larger than a shirt-button, weighing no more than a hummingbird’s heart. In my palm it rests, warm from my pocket, cool to the eye, glinting like a miniature moon. To some, it is the least of our legal tender, an afterthought rattling in vending machines, a relic barely worth bending to retrieve if it slips through a hole in the pants. Yet I stand here, as your President, to tell you that this dime is neither small nor humble; it is a seed, a summons, a covenant. And what we choose to do with it will decide—yes, decide—whether the American chorus still has verses worth singing.\n\nFirst, let us remember whose visage graces this coin. It is Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the man who taught us that fear itself is the only paralysis we cannot afford. When polio clawed at his legs, he strapped braces of steel to his will. When depression clawed at the nation, he strapped a people to purpose. He gave us fireside chats instead of fire and sword, a New Deal when the old deals had collapsed. So the moment that dime touches your fingers, you touch a story of resilience. Do not spend it rashly; summon it. Let Roosevelt’s lifted chin become your own.\n\nConsider the option of gravity: drop the dime in a parking meter and buy yourself 12 minutes of standing still. But even here, resolve to stand with intention. Use those minutes to call a grandparent who still uses a flip phone. Read three pages of the Constitution—the Preamble will fit neatly into that span. Watch a mother buckle twins into a minivan and silently salute her private heroism. You will discover that 12 minutes can stretch into a cathedral if you enter them on your knees.\n\nOr take the dime to a fountain. But do not wish upon it; work upon it. Cast it not with closed eyes but with open ledger. Whisper to the water: “Let this coin carry the dreams of the kid who sleeps in a shelter tonight.” Then match that 10 ¢ with 10 $—because charity scales when we decide it must—and send the sum to a shelter that buys toothpaste and dignity in equal measure. One fountain splash becomes a ripple that becomes a tide; tides do not ask permission to redraw coastlines.\n\nPerhaps you are a student, ramen-rich and cash-poor. Lay that dime on your desk as a paperweight for your dreams. When the textbook timeline of the Great Society feels like ancient marble, let the coin remind you that history is minted daily. Write on a sticky note: “Tuition is paid one dime, one decision, one all-nighter at a time.” Tape it above the coin. Every dawn you return to that desk, you are minting your own currency of grit.\n\nIf you are an entrepreneur, carry the dime in your left shoe. Let it ride against the arch like a bullish pebble. When the investor says “no,” when the prototype fails iteration 37, when the bank balance flickers red, that dime will bruise you just enough to remember discomfort is the interest ambition charges. And when at last the term sheet is signed, retrieve the dime, polish it on your sleeve, and frame it behind your desk. Tell your interns: “Our first valuation was ten cents.” They will laugh, then lean in.\n\nShould you be a grandparent, press that dime into a tiny palm on a Saturday stroll. Tell the child, “This is not money; it’s a magic trick. Hold it up to the sun and you’ll see a torch, an olive branch, and if you blink fast, an eagle learning to fly.” Then walk her to the library. Show her how to slide the dime across the photocopy card slot when her allowance runs short. Teach her that knowledge costs less than candy and lasts longer than teeth. Years later, when she stands on a commencement stage gripping a doctorate instead of a diploma dipped in debt, she will still feel the serrated edge of that dime against her fingerprint and know liberty has a texture.\n\nIf your heart is broken—because hearts in a republic are routinely broken—let the dime be the first brick in rebuilding. Place it on your nightstand like a tiny monolith. Each sunrise, add another coin: a penny for patience, a nickel for nuance, a quarter for courage. By the end of the month you will have built a cairn marking the trail back to yourself. And because grief is communal, take that growing stack to a food bank and trade metal for meals. You will discover that healing is not subtraction—pain minus pain—but addition: sorrow plus service equals solidarity.\n\nAnd should you be the citizen who mutters, “But Mr. President, it’s just a dime,” I answer with the conviction of every Roosevelt who ever rallied a nation: America was never “just.” We were never just colonies, never just a wilderness, never just a refuge. We declared that all men are created equal when the world replied, “Impossible—just colonies.” We built railroads when cynics sneered, “Impossible—just desert.” We landed on the Sea of Tranquility when doubters clucked, “Impossible—just a dream.” Impossibility is merely possibility that has not yet met an American wielding ten unapologetic cents.\n\nTherefore, my friends, do not disdain the small. The dime is our democracy in microcosm: ridged edges to remind us that liberty must have borders, lest it smooth into tyranny; a profile, not a crown, to remind us that leaders serve best when they listen hardest; an olive branch on the reverse, because even a ten-cent piece knows the price of peace is eternal vigilance wrapped in humility.\n\nI leave you with this charge: tomorrow, carry a dime in your pocket separate from the jangling rest. Let it be your private talisman. When the newsfeed curdles your stomach, rub the coin like a worry stone. When the traffic light stalls at red, stare at Roosevelt’s profile and ask, “What would he do with these 90 seconds?” When the day ends and the dime is still there, raise it to the lamplight and inspect the year. Google what happened that year: maybe 1968, when we orbited the moon and mourned a King; maybe 2001, when we lost towers and found one another. Trace your fingertip across the date and feel time compress. Realize that you are now the mint that stamps tomorrow.\n\nAnd then—only then—decide whether you will spend it, save it, share it, or sanctify it. Whatever you do, do it with ceremony. Because when citizens treat even the smallest common object as sacred, the republic itself becomes too valuable to squander.\n\nMay God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.", "cost": 0.002965, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}], "result": true}

Don’t forget to include the keywords waste, material and meal. Have more than 30 sentences in your response.", "response": "Aluminium cans have become one of the most familiar sights in any kitchen, camping backpack, school lunchbox or emergency bunker because they offer an almost ideal marriage of lightness, strength and absolute barrier against the enemies of every meal: oxygen, moisture and light.  \nYear after year, the metal’s naturally occurring oxide skin regenerates itself, so the same material that once carried a fizzy soda can later be re-melted and re-formed to protect peaches, chilli con carne or coconut milk without ever losing its integrity.  \nFood processors choose aluminium because it cools and heats rapidly, allowing the sterilisation step called retorting to finish faster, which in turn locks taste and nutrition inside while locking bacteria out.  \nFrom the moment a flat disc called a “cup” is deep-drawn in a press, the future can begins life as a precisely calibrated shell whose thickness is thinner than a postcard yet able to withstand more than ninety pounds of internal pressure.  \nThat mechanical miracle matters, because every gram of excess material removed translates into freight savings across millions of cans, and freight savings translate directly into lower carbon footprints for every meal that reaches a remote pantry shelf.  \nInside the shell, a sprayed-on epoxy phenolic lacquer separates the food from the metal, preventing the slightest interaction that could darken a delicate artichoke heart or give a metallic tinge to a child’s applesauce.  \nFillers blast the open cans with steam to drive out residual oxygen, then drop in the exact weight of peas, curry or dog food before seaming the lid at a speed of six hundred cans a minute, a rhythm faster than any human heartbeat.  \nOnce the double seam is closed, the can becomes a tiny pressure vessel that can sit on a barge, a camel saddle or a space station without calling attention to itself, quietly waiting for the moment someone craves a meal.  \nIn developing regions, the arrival of aluminium cans has reduced seasonal famine cycles because harvest surpluses—tomatoes in July, mangoes in May—can be stored for more than a year without refrigeration, an achievement glass or plastic cannot match at the same cost.  \nConsumers seldom notice that the pull-tab they flick skyward is an engineering response to an earlier era’s solid waste nightmare: the removable ring that too often ended up in beaches, bird gullets or playground sand.  \nToday’s stay-on-tab stays fixed to the can, eliminating that notorious waste stream and cutting the number of sharp metal shards that once lacerated feet and tyres alike.  \nBecause aluminium is prized by recyclers, the same can may re-enter the loop within sixty days of collection, shredded, de-lacquered and melted at seven hundred degrees Celsius into a billet that becomes either a new can or an alloy wheel, laptop shell or aircraft panel.  \nThat circular journey matters: every tonne of recycled aluminium saves nine tonnes of bauxite ore, fourteen thousand kilowatt-hours of electricity and the associated emissions, a calculus that turns yesterday’s waste into today’s sustainable material.  \nA single recycled can saves enough energy to power a television for three hours, so a family that rinses and bins twelve cans after a weekend barbecue has funded an entire evening of binge-watching with no additional mining.  \nMunicipal collection programmes have learned to piggy-back on this value: in many cities the aluminium fraction pays for the recovery of less lucrative fractions like yoghurt pots or juice cartons, effectively subsidising the whole waste management ballet.  \nDesigners of camping stoves exploit the can’s heat conductivity by turning empty containers into lightweight pots; hikers boil water directly inside a rinsed bean can, shave grams off their packs and still enjoy a hot meal at altitude.  \nDisaster-relief agencies stockpile millions of pre-printed aluminium cans because they are non-combustible: even if a warehouse burns, the inner seal survives, so rice, lentils or infant formula remains edible after the flames die down.  \nArtists inscribe intricate patterns on post-consumer cans, transforming the discarded material into lampshades, Christmas ornaments or even couture gowns that shimmer like scale mail on Paris runways, proving that the line between waste and material is cultural, not physical.  \nFrom a microbiological standpoint, the hermetic seal of a properly formed can is so reliable that botulism spores, which thrive in low-oxygen environments, cannot germinate unless the retort cycle was faulty, making the aluminium can one of the safest food packages ever invented.  \nShelf-life tests show canned pumpkin still delivering full vitamin A activity after thirty-two months at forty degrees Celsius, a threshold that plastic pouches or laminated cartons cannot reach without sophisticated oxygen scavengers.  \nThe can’s opacity is another quiet virtue: riboflavin, folate and other light-sensitive vitamins degrade rapidly in glass jars left on sunny shelves, whereas aluminium turns every pantry into a cave where nutrients sleep undisturbed until the moment of the meal.  \nEconomists trace the democratisation of tuna, salmon and even escargot to the aluminium can, because once a delicacy is divorced from ice chains, it can reach landlocked populations who would otherwise encounter it only in stories.  \nGlobally, 180 billion aluminium cans are produced every year; lined up end-to-end they would circle the equitor more than twenty-five times, a metallic necklace testifying to humanity’s faith in a material lightweight enough to float yet tough enough to travel.  \nCritics rightly point out that bauxite mining scars landscapes and that red-mud tailings can poison rivers, but life-cycle analyses show that if the global recycling rate rose from today’s 69% to 90%, the aluminium can would outperform steel, glass and multilayer cartons on virtually every environmental metric, including water use and greenhouse intensity.  \nInnovation is pushing the envelope further: peel-off film lids welded to shallow aluminium trays allow ready-meal producers to offer retorted curry that reheats in three minutes, combining the convenience of a microwaveable tub with the shelf-stability of a traditional can.  \nManufacturers have also introduced easy-open ends for seniors whose grip strength is fading, so a arthritis-stricken grandparent can still access a protein-rich meal without asking for help, preserving dignity along with nutrition.  \nThe same material that shields astronauts’ asparagus aboard the International Space Station also lines the pockets of survivalists burying caches in backyard bunkers, a symmetry that underscores the can’s role as a temporal bridge between today’s surplus and tomorrow’s hunger.  \nEven the sound of a can opening carries psychological weight: psychologists have measured a statistically significant drop in cortisol levels among stressed subjects who hear that familiar pop and hiss, a conditioned promise that calories are imminent.  \nYet the story is not finished: start-ups are experimenting with smart inks that change colour when botulinum toxin is present, turning the can itself into a diagnostic device that could prevent outbreaks and save lives.  \nOthers are exploring collapsible aluminium bottles that behave like cans during retorting but stack flat after consumption, shrinking the volume of household waste and making it easier for consumers to store empties until recycling day.  \nIn the global south, micro-entrepreneurs collect discarded cans, flatten them into sheets and hand-punch them into cookstove parts, irrigation washers or even roofing tiles, demonstrating that a humble food package can seed an entire informal economy.  \nThe lesson is clear: aluminium cans are not just passive vessels but active agents in the choreography of modern food systems, turning fleeting harvests into perennial meals, converting mining risk into circular opportunity, and proving that with enough ingenuity, yesterday’s waste can become tomorrow’s most valuable material.", "cost": 0.0031445, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:existence", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"keywords": ["waste", "material", "meal"]}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 31}], "result": true}

The first would be to estimate how many time you have everyday for parenting, and is that enough....\"\nAvoid using the following keywords: sleep, cook, feed\nMention the keyword 'schedule' for more than 5 times.", "response": "Parenting Plan 101: How a Helper Turns Chaos into Cooperation  \n-------------------------------------------------------------  \nYou may have to meet with a helper to work out a parenting plan. The first step is to estimate how many hours you truly have every day for parenting, and—crucially—whether that amount is enough.  \n\nMost parents begin the conversation feeling defensive: “I’m already stretched thin.” The helper’s job is not to judge; it is to translate your hectic routine into a living, breathing schedule that protects both your child’s needs and your own sanity. Below is a field-tested roadmap you can take into that first meeting and leave with a calendar everyone trusts.\n\n1. Run the “Time Reality” Audit  \nBring a blank weekly grid. Colour in every 30-minute block you already spend on direct parenting: reading aloud, supervising homework, driving to violin, soothing tears after a playground squabble. Be brutal—if the cellphone comes out, the colour stays off. When the grid is full, add up the coloured squares. If the total is under two hours on a school day, the schedule needs surgery, not a band-aid.\n\n2. Rank the Non-Negotiables  \nHelpers use a simple 1-to-5 ladder: 1 = “flexible,” 5 = “immovable.” Bath-time might be a 5 for the parent who works late shifts, while Saturday football is a 5 for the ex-partner who coaches. Write each 5 in bold on a sticky note and park it on the calendar first. These anchors keep the schedule honest; everything else bends around them.\n\n3. Build the “Hand-Off Highway”  \nConflict flares when transitions are vague. Agree on a exact spot (front door, car park, school gate) and a two-minute buffer either side. Put the hand-off into the shared online schedule in capital letters: “TUESDAY 6:02 PM – CURBSIDE.” Once the child knows the routine, the schedule becomes a neutral third party rather than Mummy versus Daddy.\n\n4. Insert Micro-Dates  \nA parenting plan is not only logistics; it is emotional glue. Slot in 15-minute ‘micro-dates’ with each child three times a week: Tuesday breakfast jam on toast, Thursday walk around the block, Sunday make-believe tea party. Alarm them in your phone so they feel as non-negotiable as the dentist. These fragments keep the heart of the schedule warm.\n\n5. Stress-Test Before You Sign  \nHelpers recommend a 14-day trial printed on paper. Stick it to the fridge, but mark two “what-if” days: one parent late, school closed, or a last-minute project. If the schedule collapses, tweak only one variable at a time—never rip it up. A resilient parenting plan is a set of Lego bricks, not a glass sculpture.\n\n6. Digital Hygiene  \nShare the final schedule through a co-parenting app that time-stamps changes. Disable notifications during the child’s pick-up window; nothing destabilises a routine faster than a ping that reads, “Actually, can we swap?” The goal is to make the schedule the quiet authority, not the latest battleground.\n\n7. Quarterly Tune-Up  \nBirthday parties morph into sleep-away camps, tutoring sessions turn into chess tournaments. Every three months, drag the helper back for a 30-minute tune-up. Compare the old forecast with the new reality, then re-print. A schedule that grew with the child is a gift to the child; a schedule frozen in time becomes a straitjacket.\n\nCommon Pitfalls to Flag with Your Helper  \n- “Mirror Hours” Myth: thinking the child needs identical hours with each adult. Aim for balanced quality, not symmetrical quantity.  \n- Overstuffed Weekends: packing every Saturday with activities leaves no white space for the child to decompress.  \n- Guilt Padding: adding extra outings because you missed a Wednesday. The schedule should reward consistency, not愧疚感 (Mandarin for guilt).\n\nExit the meeting with three artefacts:  \n1. A one-page English schedule taped in both houses.  \n2. A phone wallpaper version for the child, if old enough.  \n3. A helper’s business card clipped to the fridge, permission to call before small issues snowball.\n\nRemember, the perfect parenting plan is the one you can obey when exhausted, defend when challenged, and modify without shame. Keep the schedule visible, keep it current, and it will quietly parent for you when your own voice is too tired to speak.", "cost": 0.00191, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:forbidden_words", "keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"forbidden_words": ["sleep", "cook", "feed"]}, {"relation": "at least", "keyword": "schedule", "frequency": 6}], "result": true}

Use some words in all caps in your response, but those all-caps words should appear at most 10 times.", "response": "Quick answer: AVOCADO is NOT a fish.\n\nNow, let’s dive deeper.\n\nTHE SALMON STORY\nSalmon are SILVER missiles of cold, nutrient-rich rivers and seas. Born in fresh water, they migrate to the ocean, then miraculously return—sometimes leaping waterfalls—to the exact gravel bed where they hatched. Their flesh turns coral-pink from a crustacean-rich diet, concentrating omega-3 oils that cardiologists call BRAIN food. For millennia, Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest celebrated the “first salmon” ceremony, releasing the skeleton intact so the spirit could guide future runs. Today, wild stocks are threatened by dams, warming streams, and crowded pens of farmed ATLANTIC salmon that occasionally escape and rewrite local gene scripts.\n\nTHE AVOCADO STORY\nAvocado is a BERRY—yes, a single-seeded giant berry hanging from tropical laurel trees that exude a faint scent of bay leaf. Long before toast influencers, Mesoamericans called it āhuacatl (testicle tree) for both shape and aphrodisiac lore. Spanish conquistadors mashed it into guacamole, but the fruit’s SUPER power lay unseen: a lipid profile once shunned for “too much fat” is now praised for monounsaturated oleic acid, the same heart-healthy molecule that makes olive oil famous. Grown on every continent except Antarctica, avocados drain 70 liters of water per fruit in drought-plagued Michoacán, turning brunch into an ethical puzzle.\n\nCOLLISION COURSE\nSushi bars marry the two: cool, buttery avocado blankets fiery salmon in a CA roll, uniting land and sea fat in one bite. Yet their supply chains diverge wildly—one swims, one grows; one demands cold integrity, the other room-temp ripeness. Choosing between them is unnecessary; understanding both is urgent. Eat consciously: look for WILD Alaskan salmon certified by the Marine Stewardship Council and avocados stamped “SMETA” for sustainable water use. Then savor the Delicious IRONY that the non-fish can taste oceanic and the fish can feel almost vegetarian when paired with green, citrus-laced fruit.\n\nBite, learn, repeat—just don’t call the avocado a fish.", "cost": 0.0009815, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:capital_word_frequency", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"capital_relation": "less than", "capital_frequency": 11}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 1}], "result": false}

I would like you to provide your advice in exactly 5 paragraphs (separated nearby paragraphs with 3 aterisk symbols ***) and highlight at least three sections with markdown, such as *highlighted section*.", "response": "Starting any business begins with a crystal-clear understanding of the *problem you’re solving* and the *audience that desperately needs it*. Spend more time interviewing potential customers than designing logos; a week of candid conversations can save you months of building something nobody wants. Validate demand with simple, low-cost experiments—landing pages, wait-lists, or concierge versions of the service—before committing serious capital. Your goal is to collect authentic signals, not polite encouragement; if people aren’t willing to pre-pay, join a beta, or refer a friend, you haven’t found pain worth paying for yet.\n\n***\n\nOnce the need is proven, craft a *lean but defensible business model*: know exactly how you’ll charge, what it costs to deliver, and what keeps competitors at bay. Map every dollar from customer acquisition to delivery; if the math doesn’t work on a spreadsheet, it won’t magically improve in real life. Identify which metrics matter most—gross margin, payback period, lifetime value—and create a dashboard you review every Monday morning like a doctor checking vital signs. Ruthlessly remove nice-to-have features until the offer is so focused that prospects immediately “get it” within a ten-second explanation; clarity beats complexity every time.\n\n***\n\nCapital discipline separates long-term winners from cautionary tales. Bootstrap as far as possible—*every dollar you haven’t spent is a future experiment you can still afford*—and treat external funding, if any, as rocket fuel, not oxygen. Negotiate vendor terms, trade equity for expertise instead of cash when feasible, and always keep six months of survival cash in the bank. Track runway weekly; the moment your operating buffer drops below four months, cut discretionary spend before growth initiatives. Remember that the fastest way to double your runway is to halve your burn, not double your revenue.\n\n***\n\nBuild the smallest team that can deliver tomorrow’s milestone, not today’s comfort. Hire missionaries, not mercenaries—people who perk up when they hear the customer problem, not just the salary range. Document processes early so tribal knowledge doesn’t walk out with the first departure, and institute a culture where anyone can propose killing a stale idea without embarrassment. Create *feedback loops that are brutally honest yet psychologically safe*: weekly retros, anonymous suggestion channels, and a “red-team” ritual where the newest employee is invited to poke holes in the product. Celebrate the bugs you catch internally; they’re cheaper than the ones customers find.\n\n***\n\nExpect at least three near-death experiences in the first two years—*resilience is a feature, not a bug*. Keep your personal burn rate low so the company’s runway never dictates your life choices, and maintain routines that preserve mental sharpness: exercise, mentors, and a peer group of founders who speak the same language of doubt. Schedule quarterly “strategic unplug” days where you step back to ask, “If I started fresh tomorrow, would I rebuild this same business?” If the honest answer is no, pivot early and proudly; iteration is not failure, procrastination is.

On a [season] morning I finally cleared half a day from my calendar, bought my [ticket_price] pass online, and stepped inside what locals call “the blue heart of [city].” Below are the moments that stuck with me—plus insider tips you can swipe for your own visit on [travel_date].\n\n1. The Shark Tunnel: A 330-foot gliding sidewalk that whisked me through a world of sand-tiger sharks, green sea turtles, and a sawfish named [favorite_animal].  \n2. Touch Tanks: I ticked a stingray’s velvety wing (yes, they feel like wet mushrooms) while a marine educator told us how to move our fingers in a “[friendly_gesture]” so the rays know we’re not bait.  \n3. Penguin Playhouse: The giggles are contagious when African black-footed penguins torpedo past the viewing window, chasing the keeper’s [local_fish] snacks.  \n4. Behind-the-Scenes Tour: For an extra [extra_cost] I donned a hairnet and saw the kitchen where 1,500 lbs. of restaurant-grade seafood are prepped daily.  \n5. Sleepovers & Yoga: Believe it or not, you can downward-dog in front of the shark lagoon during [aquarium_event] or roll out a sleeping bag for a family snooze under the sea.\n\nPlanning Primer  \n• Best time: Arrive at [opening_time] when the school crowds haven’t mobbed the tunnel; you’ll feel like you have the sharks to yourself.  \n• Discount hack: Check the [discount_source] newsletter—last week they released a code for 15 % off after 4 p.m.  \n• Parking: The [nearby_landmark] garage validates for 3 hours; after that it’s only $[parking_fee] flat rate.\n\nSustainability Angle  \nRipley’s partners with the [conservation_project] to rehabilitate injured sea turtles. Part of every [ticket_price] ticket feeds a rescue fund that has returned 250+ turtles to the Atlantic.\n\nGrab-And-Go Lunch  \nForget soggy aquarium nuggets. Walk two blocks to [local_restaurant] for a lobster-roll flight—perfect picnic food you can scarf at the outdoor tables facing the harbor.\n\nHow Long to Stay  \nAquarium-only: 2–3 hours. Add the behind-the-scenes tour and you’re looking at 4.5. If you’re traveling with toddlers, factor in the [play_zone] soft-play area; they’ll burn energy while you sip the obligatory shark-fin latte.\n\nNight to Remember  \nBook the [sleepover_date] sleepover and wake up to breakfast beside the jellyfish wall. I left with a complimentary photo of me in PJ’s, framed by moon jellies—proof that dreams literally glow at Ripley’s.\n\nBottom Line  \nWhether you’re a solo traveler hunting Instagram gold or a parent desperate for a rainy-day win, Ripley’s Aquarium in [Location] is a deep dive into joy. Swap your shoes for wonder, your watch for whale-shark-shaped clocks, and let the current carry you.\n\nSafe travels, and remember: in the shark tunnel the only thing you’ll need to fear is running out of phone storage.", "cost": 0.0014775, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 7}], "result": true}

Just hours later, the Senate voted 68-32 to force ByteDance to divest TikTok within nine months or face an outright U.S. ban, a bipartisan spectacle driven by fresh intelligence alleging the platform’s recommendation algorithm can be weaponized to amplify divisive content in swing states and could, according to a classified briefing, “tilt an election by three percentage points for the price of a viral dance.” While lawmakers high-fived over national-security optics, Fort Lauderdale sank beneath a foot of April rain in a climate surprise that forced Florida’s GOP governor to quietly request $2.1 billion in new FEMA funds, a request that collided head-on with the House Freedom Caucus’s newly unveiled budget blueprint which proposes paying for disaster relief by repealing the very green-energy tax credits that Treasury says would cut nationwide emissions 42% by 2035 and thus prevent even costlier floods. Wall Street, allergic to uncertainty, swung 740 points from trough to peak as algorithmic funds parsed theCourt’s antitrust ruling against Google, which opened the door for the DOJ to seek a breakup of Alphabet’s ad-tech stack, a maneuver analysts say could unlock $200 billion in trapped value for rival publishers yet simultaneously vaporize $1 trillion in market cap if the search giant’s AI cloud contracts are collateral-damaged.

Your article must end with the exact phrase \"Is there anything else I can help with?\". No other words should follow this phrase.", "response": "The Reality of Disability  \nBy Someone Who Has One, and Everyone Who Loves Someone Who Does  \n\n1. The First Lie  \nThe first lie most of us swallow is that disability is a tragedy that happens to other people. In truth, it is a lottery with unlimited tickets: premature birth, a patch of black ice, a rogue cell, a distracted driver, a quiet gene that wakes up at forty, a war that outlives its peace treaty. One day you are parking in the “expectant mother” stall; the next week you are calculating the grade of a ramp that does not yet exist. Disability is not a far-away island; it is a slow tide that can reach any shoreline.\n\n2. The Second Lie  \nThe second lie is that the disabled body is a broken version of the able body. Medical textbooks call this “loss of function.” In everyday life it sounds like “I’m so sorry,” whispered at us in grocery lines, as if we are attending our own funeral in the produce section. The truth is more unruly: bodies change, minds recalibrate, and “function” is renegotiated every sunrise. My friend Jesse, who lost his vision at nineteen, did not “lose his eyes”; he gained a dog named Nina who negotiates traffic better than any GPS, and a memory for opera arias that turns subway platforms into concert halls. The deficit model is a spreadsheet that refuses to notice new columns being added.\n\n3. The Price of Admission  \nDisability is expensive in dollars and dignity. A motorized wheelchair that costs as much as a small car is deemed “a luxury” by insurance reviewers who have never tried to push themselves uphill with one arm. A deaf patient is told the hospital “forgot” to book an interpreter for the third appointment in a row. A chronically ill graduate student forfeits her stipend because she used up her “allowed” sick days. These are not anecdotes; they are line items on a balance sheet that weighs profit against pulse. Poverty and disability overlap so often that the Venn diagram is nearly a circle. In the United States, a disabled person is twice as likely to live below the poverty line; worldwide the unemployment rate hovers near 50 percent even in countries that boast record-low joblessness. The message is unspoken but unmistakable: participation in society requires a cover charge many cannot pay.\n\n4. The Choreography of Access  \n“Accessibility” is usually drawn as a stick figure in a wheelchair on a blue sign. In real life it is choreography, timing, and trust. It is the barista who remembers that the ceramic mug is easier for shaky hands, the teacher who emails the slides the night before lecture so screen-reader software can practice the words, the neighbor who shovels the sidewalk to the exact width of a walker. Access is mutual aid disguised as mundane courtesy. When it is present, we barely notice; when it is absent, we fracture. One missing caption can turn a job interview into humiliation; one broken elevator can turn a hospital into a cliff.\n\n5. The Gladiator Spectacle  \nPop culture prefers its disabled people in two flavors: supercrip or charity case. The Paralympian who bench-presses a small bus is trotted out to remind everyone that “the only disability is a bad attitude.” Meanwhile the募捐 poster child tilts her head so we can feel lucky we are not her. Both narratives erase the middle, where most of us live: ordinary people who hate yoga, forget to take our meds, and still need to buy milk. Inspiration porn is the tax we pay for public existence; it sells clicks, not ramps.\n\n6. The Quiet Resistance  \nResistance is rarely cinematic. It is a teenager with dyslexia writing fan fiction on speech-to-text at 2 a.m. because stories belong to her, too. It is a mom with lupus pacing her energy in color-coded blocks so she can read “one more chapter” to her son. It is coalitions of wheelchair users crawling up the Capitol steps in 1990, and it is also a blind coder uploading a free browser extension today that will make tomorrow’s newspaper readable. Revolutions are built from micro-adaptations stacked like Lego until the architecture of exclusion buckles.\n\n7. The Future Is Already Here  \nAutonomous vehicles could liberate millions who cannot drive, but only if designers remember that a deaf passenger cannot hear a “Your ride is here” honk. Artificial intelligence promises real-time sign-language translation, yet trains its algorithms on videos of able-bodied actors pretending to sign. Gene editing hovers at the border of prevention and eugenics. The choices being coded into prototypes right now will decide whether the twenty-second century is more inclusive or more segregated than the last. Disability justice is not a side quest; it is the main storyline of how humans treat variance.\n\n8. The Ask  \nIf you are still reading, you are part of the circuitry. Start by believing us when we describe pain you cannot see. Turn your workplace into a place that works: publish salaries, allow remote days, caption the Zoom. Vote for transit budgets that fund more than roads. Teach your children the sign for “friend.” Do not applaud when a restaurant menu is readable; demand it, then tip as if civil rights were included in the bill. Most importantly, refuse the mythology that you will never be us. The line between bodies is permeable, and mercy ripples outward. Build the ramp before you need it; the curb will come for your ankles eventually.\n\nIs there anything else I can help with?", "cost": 0.0023245, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Is there anything else I can help with?"}], "result": true}

Think of it as a 24-hour, planet-wide dash-cam compiled by eight billion accidental cinematographers. After sifting through countless clips, transit-planning documents, and first-person threads, here are the moments that still make my circuits blink in disbelief.\n\n1. The Tokyo Owl Commute  \nA rush-hour rider on the Marunouchi Line looked up from their phone and realized the “hat” on the seat opposite was, in fact, a live snowy owl—talons gently gripping the vinyl, eyes slowly rotating like amber security cameras. The bird belonged to a licensed falconer who’d missed the last pet-cargo van and been granted special permission to bring the owl home via subway. Every passenger spontaneously agreed to keep a three-seat buffer so the owl could stay calm. The resulting footage feels like Studio Ghibli CGI until you notice the reflection of neon station lights in its pupils.\n\n2. Berlin’s Club-U-Bahn  \nAt 3 a.m. on a Sunday, the U8 between Hermannstraße and Boddinstraße turned into an unannounced pop-up rave. A DJ wheeled a battery-powered mixer and two speakers into the front carriage, then clipped a strobe to the handrail. Within two stops, the entire car was dancing—business shoes, club boots, even a stroller rocking in time. Berlin’s transit authority later admitted they’d quietly allowed it as a stress-test for new noise-dampening materials. The only casualty: one glitter-covered monthly pass that melted in the subwoofer exhaust vent.\n\n3. The Lagos Floating Bus  \nLagos, Nigeria, floods so predictably that danfo drivers sometimes retrofit minibuses with empty oil drums and outboard motors. A viral clip shows a yellow bus “sailing” across a submerged intersection while a conductor stands shin-deep inside, calmly collecting fares and bailing water with a plastic bowl. The driver waves a red bandanna like a matador whenever the engine coughs. Commuters on the upper deck open umbrellas upside-down to keep splashing wakes from soaking their phones. GoogleMaps ETA: “Eventually.”\n\n4. Mumbai’s Musical Ladies  \nEvery 9:03 a.m. on the slow train from Churchgate to Virar, a group of fisherwomen board with 30-kilo baskets of silver pomfret. For years they haggled in Marathi over seat real estate until one day a commuter began beat-boxing their cadence. Within weeks, the entire carriage had evolved into a rolling choir—clapping konnakol rhythms, layering fish names as percussion lyrics, turning the 60-minute ride into a free concert. Tourism officials now quietly schedule foreign journalists on that train just to witness it.\n\n5. The Kyiv Metro Wedding  \nFebruary 2022: a couple whose outdoor ceremony was canceled by air-raid sirens asked the station master at Zoloti Vorota if they could hold a five-minute ceremony on the platform. Word spread; strangers formed an honor guard with phone lights, a bridesmaid’s bouquet became a repurposed grocery-store sunflower, and the train PA piped Wagner’s “Bridal Chorus” over the emergency intercom. The train that arrived during the kiss waited an extra 90 seconds—an eternity in interval scheduling—while the driver leaned out and saluted. Half the car cried, the other half live-streamed.\n\n6. Vancouver’s Silent Disco SkyTrain  \nTransLink once partnered with a headphone manufacturer to test bone-conduction headsets. Riders who downloaded the app could tune into three playlists synced to GPS waypoints. From the outside, the carriage looked like an ordinary Tuesday; inside, 200 heads bobbed in silent synchronization, breaking into silent giggles when the train crossed the Fraser River bridge and the app switched everyone to the same power ballad. The experiment ended after one week because too many people missed their stops.\n\n7. The Santiago Library Bus  \nChilean students protested education cuts by turning a decommissioned 1987 Mercedes bus into a rolling library. Volunteers shelved 3,000 books where seats once folded, painted the exterior with chalkboard paint, and invited riders to write poems that were erased each night to make room for new ones. One Monday morning, the driver opened the rear emergency window and began reading Neruda over the intercom while stalled in traffic. By Friday, impromptu readings had spread to four other lines; the government finally agreed to meet protest demands, but only after requesting 12 extra copies of “Twenty Love Poems” for ministry staff.\n\n8. The Arctic Bus to Nowhere  \nIn Norilsk, Russia, the world’s northernmost trolleybus route (Line 2) ends at a concrete turnaround that faces 200 km of tundra. One winter dusk, a YouTuber rode it end-to-end just to film the moment the overhead sparks turned the falling snow copper-green. Halfway back, the power froze and the driver pulled out a Soviet-era guitar, leading the nine freezing passengers in a sing-along until the wires thawed. No one complained; being stuck in a warm, lit box beats standing outside at –42 °C.\n\nWhat ties these fragments together isn’t just quirk; it’s the reminder that public transit is the last truly democratic room we build together. You can’t filter who boards, so the only options are cohabitation or conversation. And sometimes, when the timing is right, that cohabitation turns into a spontaneous festival, a protest, a wedding, or simply the moment an owl blinks at you like you’re the strange one.\n\nIf your own commute feels dull tomorrow, look up—someone might be tuning a secret soundtrack, or balancing tomorrow’s dinner on their lap, or writing the poem you didn’t know you needed.

Make sure the entire response is in English and no capital letters are used.", "response": "a navigable freeway is not merely a ribbon of concrete stretching toward the horizon; it is a living artery through which the pulse of human ambition, fear, and curiosity is continuously pumped. every on-ramp is a threshold, every mile marker a quiet philosopher silently asking, “where are you going, and why?” the moment you merge left and the speedometer needle climbs past fifty, you enter a paradoxical space: you are both radically alone—encased in glass and steel—and communally entangled in a choreography of strangers whose taillights blink like distant constellations. the navigable freeway, then, is a paradox of engineered freedom: the more standardized its lanes, the more intimate the dreams it ferries.\n\nconsider the first time you drove alone at night. the dashboard glowed like a miniature city, and the white stripes flickered past with hypnotic regularity. the radio crackled between stations, offering fragments of other lives—tejano accordion, late-night call-in theology, emergency broadcast tests—before settling on a song you did not choose but somehow needed. in that space, the freeway became a confessional booth on wheels. you spoke aloud to no one, rehearsed arguments you would never have, forgave people you could no longer call. the road listened without judgment, its only response the steady hum of tread on asphalt. this is the secret covenant drivers unwittingly sign: we surrender our footprints to the state, and in exchange the freeway absorbs our unspoken stories, dissolving them into the blacktop like so much rubber dust.\n\nbut the navigable freeway is also a time machine. exit 127 might deliver you to a town whose diner still serves coffee in thick ceramic mugs, where the waitress calls you “hon” and means it, where the clock above the register has been paused at 11:47 since 1983. twenty miles farther, exit 142 spills you into a future of distribution centers and algorithmic warehouses where drones hover like impatient dragonflies. the same road, two毛细血管 of time, accessed by the flick of a turn signal. the freeway compresses chronology; it allows a commuter to breakfast in the twentieth century and lunch in the twenty-first, all before the dashboard clock flips to p.m.\n\nwe must also speak of the languages spoken here. there is the official lexicon—mile markers, hov lanes, gore points, deceleration ramps—but beneath it flows an underground tongue of light flashes, lane-weave apologies, the subtle nod of a trucker who has seen you signal and eases off the throttle to let you pass. headlights brighten twice: “i am here, do not swerve.” hazard lights blink once: “thank you.” these micro-rituals compose a grammar of mutual survival, a silent anthology of courtesies performed at seventy miles an hour. break the code—cut too close, hog the left lane—and the freeway instantly reverts to a battlefield of bent metal and latent rage. thus, every driver becomes an accidental anthropologist, deciphering the moods of strangers through the tilt of a mirror or the cant of a tire.\n\nfreeways are also archives of ecological contradiction. the same concrete that sliced through coyote trails and monarch flyways now bears, on its embankments, pioneering colonies of wildflowers whose seeds hitchhiked on radiator grilles and muddy hubcaps. look closely at the center median of interstate 5 near san clemente: there, encased in a triangle of chain-link, grows a lone torrey pine, its roots clasping granite river rock trucked in as ballast during the nixon administration. every spring it releases pollen that drifts across six lanes, fertilizing gardens in mission viejo whose owners will never know their tomatoes are part highway. thus, the navigable freeway is both killer and cradle, a linear monument to our inability to choose between motion and rootedness.\n\neconomically, the freeway is a lottery ticket printed in asphalt. a single new interchange can convert a sleepy apricot orchard into a constellation of drive-through pharmacies and fulfilment centers, raising land values by orders of magnitude overnight. yet, one overpass pillar placed six feet too far east can doom a mom-and-pop muffler shop that has survived three recessions and one marriage. the same road that carries strawberries to breakfast tables before dawn carries repossessed couches to auction houses after dusk. in this way, the freeway is america’s unofficial stock exchange: speculation is conducted at eighty miles an hour, valuations rise and fall with the price of diesel, and the ticker tape is made of shredded retreads scattered across the shoulder.\n\nbut let us descend, for a moment, beneath the macro, into the microcosmic. consider the insect splattered on your windshield: a mayfly that spent three years burrowed in the silty bottom of a irrigation canal before ascending for a single day of flight. in its final second, it encountered your vehicle, a metallic comet whose slipstream lifted it into a vortex of hot air and engine noise. the impact left a constellation of proteins and chitin, a tiny galaxy that refracts the afternoon sun into spectral wings. you activate the wipers and washer fluid—blue, like tropical antifreeze—erasing the cosmos in three rhythmic sweeps. this, too, is navigation: the negotiation between human destination and arthropod destiny, played out thousands of times per mile, all invisible to the department of transportation’s traffic cameras.\n\nthere is also the matter of exitlessness. every motorist knows the sudden panic of missing the signed ramp, of being swept past the desired off-point into a liminal zone where the freeway becomes a mundane river styx: you can see the shore you meant to reach, but the current will not release you. in that moment, the mind performs frantic calculus—how far to the next exit, how many minutes lost, whom to text, whom to blame. the freeway teaches a secular form of predestination: the granularity of choice is illusory; what matters is the long arc of on-ramps already taken. you will exit when the road permits, not when you wish. this is why u-turns are forbidden; the universe, too, disallows them.\n\nand yet, for all its regimentation, the navigable freeway remains a site of persistent enchantment. during the king fire of 2014, drivers on highway 50 east of placerville reported seeing a herd of wild mustangs galloping inside the median, flames licking at their tails, manes flecked with embers. the animals ran north, against traffic, for nearly four miles before veering into the smoke. no video exists; the event survives only in rearview mirror anecdotes and roadside diner retellings. but the story refuses to die because it answers a craving: we want the road to be more than a channel of commerce; we want it to be a stage for myth, a place where the wild and the machined still collide.\n\nfinally, consider the freeway at dawn, before the commute awakens. a lone maintenance truck drifts across the lanes, laying down a fresh constellation of botts’ dots, those ceramic buttons that click beneath tires like rosary beads. the driver wears noise-canceling headphones; he is listening to a podcast about deep-sea bioluminescence, creatures who manufacture their own stars because sunlight cannot reach them. as he steers, he imagines the asphalt as ocean floor, the dots as glowing shrimp guiding night-feeders to plankton clouds. in this quiet interchange, the navigable freeway becomes what it has always secretly been: a dark sea we agreed to illuminate together, one reflective bead at a time, so that we might keep arriving, keep departing, keep believing the next exit holds the life we have not yet dared to imagine.", "cost": 0.0032205000000000003, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 900}], "result": true}

Your file should have 4 sections, and each section should start with \"SECTION X\".", "response": "SECTION 1 – Identity & Origin Story  \nThe Rainbow Café is a queer-owned, community-first coffeehouse founded in 2021 by partners Marisol “Mari” Vargas (she/they) and Jordan Lee (he/they). After a decade of working in corporate cafés where they never felt safe to be out, Mari and Jordan pooled their savings, a small Kickstarter seeded by LGBTQ+ supporters, and a Kiva loan to lease a 900 sq ft corner storefront on the edge of the city’s historic queer district. The name “Rainbow Café” was chosen not as cliché décor but as a promise: every color of the community gets a seat, a story, and a perfectly pulled shot. The mission is tri-fold: (1) serve ethically sourced coffee & scratch-made pastries, (2) pay a real living wage with transparent tipping that never dips below $18/hr, and (3) keep one wall permanently reserved for rotating queer art shows and mutual-aid pop-ups. The brand palette is a muted 70s-teal, dusty coral, and butter yellow—queer without screaming—and the logo is a simple arc of five semi-circles that can be read as both a rainbow and a coffee steam swirl. Core values are inked (literally) on the forearms of both owners: Liberation, Joy, Consent, Accountability, and Caffeine.\n\nSECTION 2 – Menu & Vibe Design  \nThe café is open 7 a.m.–6 p.m. Tuesday–Sunday (closed Monday for mental-health hours). The espresso bar features a La Marzocco Linea PB pride-wrapped in holographic vinyl that shifts from sunrise lavender to sunset copper. Signature drinks are named after queer icons and inside jokes:  \n• Sappho’s Sip – single-origin Ethiopian Guji, floral cold brew topped with rose-cardamom foam  \n• Marsha P. Cold-fee – New Orleans–style chicory cold brew, oat milk, cane syrup  \n• Binder Burn – double ristretto, cocoa nib, chili, smoked sea salt (proceeds fund free chest-binders for transmascs)  \n• The Non-Binary – any drink split into two 6 oz halves so you never have to choose  \nPastries are baked in-house by Jordan (formerly a chemist) who reverse-engineered gluten-free croissants that actually flake. Vegan options always equal non-vegan options; if there are four cow-milk pizzas there are four vegan pizzas—no afterthoughts. Seating is 60 % communal reclaimed oak, 40 % banquettes with tucked-away power outlets so closeted teens can charge phones without outing themselves. Music policy: only queer or allied artists, hourly playlists posted on Spotify so folks can take the safe vibe home. Lighting is circadian-tuned LED; between 3–5 p.m. it shifts to warmer tones to counter post-school outing anxiety. Restrooms are labeled “Whatever” and “Whomever,” both single-stall, both ADA, both stocked with free menstrual products, condoms, and binders. Tip jars rotate monthly designs voted on by patrons; last month’s featured beaded art by Indigenous two-spirit youth.\n\nSECTION 3 – Community Programs & Revenue Streams  \n1. Pay-It-Forward Board: customers pre-pay $4 for “next queer coffee”; 50–70 redemptions per week.  \n2. Queer Barista Apprenticeship: 12-week paid program for LGBTQ+ youth aging out of foster care; graduates guaranteed 30 hrs/week at $20/hr or placement at allied cafés.  \n3. Rainbow Roasters Subscription: monthly bag featuring beans from queer or women-owned farms; 500 active subscribers ship nationwide; transparent profit split—40 % to café, 40 % to farmer, 20 % to apprenticeship fund.  \n4. Drag Brunch Nation: every Sunday 11 a.m. Tickets $25 (sliding scale $5–25); 80 % of door goes to performers; café nets on mimosas & merch. Average 120 covers, zero cis-het drag since 2021.  \n5. After-Hours Speakeasy: Thu–Sat 8 p.m.–midnight, lights dimmed, menu shifts to natural wines & small plates; 21+. Local DJ collectives rotate; cover $10 that feeds a mutual-aid pot distributed monthly.  \n6. Corporate Catering with Clause: will only service offices that show written trans-inclusive healthcare; 2023 contracts totaled $180k with 3 tech firms that changed policies to qualify.  \n\nSECTION 4 – 5-Year Vision & Call to Allyship  \nBy 2029 The Rainbow Café will:  \na) purchase the building next door (currently under queer-unfriendly landlord) to expand into a 3-floor Queer Community House: café, bookstore, 12-bed short-stay hostel for displaced LGBTQ+ youth, and a rooftop greenhouse growing herbs for the kitchen.  \nb) launch a micro-roastery in year 3, supplying 30+ allied cafés with Rainbow-label beans; goal is to move $1 M of purchasing power to queer & trans coffee farmers globally.  \nc) establish a 501(c)(3) arm, the Prism Futures Fund, seeded by 5 % of gross sales; yearly grant cycle open to grassroots organizers; first $50k granted in 2024 to a trans-led sex-worker co-op.  \nd) become carbon-negative by 2027 via on-site solar, electric cargo trike delivery, and compost exchange with trans-owned urban farms.  \nWe invite allies to:  \n• Book weekday remote-work seats (reserved 2-week ahead) – high occupancy keeps youth programs free.  \n• Sponsor an apprentice ($3,600 covers stipend & therapy fund).  \n• Stock Rainbow Roasters beans in offices & churches—email orders@rainbowcafepdx.com for wholesale packet.  \n• Vote with your wallet: if your favorite coffee chain still funds anti-trans legislation, switch one day a week to us; we’ll match your spend as a donation to Trans Lifeline.  \nPost-capitalism tastes like a perfectly steamed oat-milk cortado served in a sanctuary where your pronouns are never a burden.

Can you write me two different cover letters -- a concise version and a long version? Please make sure both options have a title wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<Concise Cover Letter – Google Software Engineer>>\n\nDear Google Hiring Team,\n\nWith 4 years of full-stack experience at Amazon-scale traffic and a patent on distributed caching, I am eager to bring my deep passion for performance engineering to Google’s Search Infrastructure team. My recent project cut P99 latency 37 % by rewriting a Go memory manager; the same rigor will help serve 9-billion queries even faster. I code in C++, Go, Java, Python, and thrive Ok, buckled up. What’s the situation?\n\n<<Long-Form Cover Letter – Google Software Engineer>>\n\nDear Google Engineering Hiring Committee,\n\nI still remember the moment I fell in love with Google technology: I was 14, downloading 200 MB of Android source over a 56 kbps modem, mesmerized that an open-source project could power a device in my pocket. Fifteen years later, after shipping planet-scale services at AWS and leading a 10-engineer team to build a sub-10 ms ad-auction engine, I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer, Search Infrastructure position at Google. My career has been a deliberate rehearsal for this role—designing fault-tolerant distributed systems, optimizing resource utilization, and cultivating the inclusive engineering culture that Google’s own research cites as critical to innovation.  \n\nAt Amazon Web Services I owned the placement scheduler for EC2 Auto-Scaling, a service that reallocates millions of virtual machines daily. By implementing a bid-pack solver in C++ and Go, I reduced average placement latency from 1.2 s to 180 ms while cutting stale placement rate by 42 %. The change reclaimed $18 M of annual infrastructure cost and required coordinating 11 teams, writing 120 design-pages, and evangelizing the solution through 23 tech talks. Google’s Borg and Omega systems share the same theoretical underpinnings; I am eager to apply my constraint optimization experience to shave milliseconds off container scheduling for billions of queries.\n\nPrior to AWS, I patented a distributed caching layer that uses consistent hashing plus Bloom-filter pre-validation to eliminate redundant lookups. Deployed across 1,300 nodes, it increased hit ratio 19 % and saved 7 MW of datacenter power. Google’s quest for carbon-neutral operations resonates deeply; I would love to adapt this technique to warm Google’s largest serving caches while lowering TCO.\n\nBeyond raw performance, I invest in future-proof code. I introduced a Test-and-Set deterministic simulation framework that finds race conditions in our RPC stack before they reach production; it now prevents an estimated 2-3 severity-1 outages per quarter. Google’s famed “test mercilessly” philosophy is my daily habit.\n\nEqually important, I cultivate the inclusive culture that turns smart individuals into unstoppable teams. I founded “Code & Curry,” a monthly hack-night that grew from 6 friends to 120 engineers, 42 % women and 35 % from under-represented groups. Mentoring 35 interns converted 32 into full-time hires; three now lead their own teams. I want to bring this same energy to Google’s Women in Engineering summit and internal g3 diversity programs.\n\nGoogle’s mission to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible” is the north star that guided every technical decision of my career. Whether shaving microseconds off a search fan-out or designing planet-scale storage, I measure success by how many people benefit from faster, greener, more reliable access to knowledge. My blend of deep-systems expertise, proven innovation record, and community leadership can help Google continue to raise the bar for what technology can do for humanity.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I welcome the chance to discuss how my experience optimizing distributed resource placement can accelerate Google’s next decade of infrastructure breakthroughs.\n\nRespectfully,\n\n[Your Name]  \n[LinkedIn] | [GitHub] | [Email]", "cost": 0.0016045, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

The second thing he noticed was the eviction notice taped to the inside of his apartment door, as if the landlord worried the paper itself might try to escape.\n\nHe read it twice, sat down on the unmade futon, and—without ceremony—cried. Not a movie-style breakdown, just a slow leak that left his cheeks raw and his throat tasting like pennies. When the tears stopped, he opened the only drawer that still slid smoothly and took out a yellow legal pad whose first half was a cemetery of crossed-out plans: “1. Stop drinking weekdays,” “4. Call Mom back,” “7. Finish degree.” He flipped to a fresh page and wrote, in capitals that wavered, “DAY 1.”\n\nMarcus had no job, five hundred and eleven dollars in checking, and a car that started on the second try if you whispered encouragingly to the steering column. What he did have was a list and, for the first time in years, the sensation of being watched—by himself, by the ghost of who he might still become.\n\nHe began with water. A glass, then two, then the shameful tower of plastic bottles he emptied, rinsed, and stacked by the door so the floor could breathe. While the apartment exhaled, he shaved the beard that had grown like kudzu across his jaw, nicking himself twice and not minding the sting because pain felt like punctuation. He put on the one shirt that didn’t smell like bar smoke, walked to the public library, and asked for books on plumbing because trade skills couldn’t be ghosted the way office emails ghosted him.\n\n every evening he came home smelling of copper and PVC glue. His hands blistered, calloused, then learned the soft surrender of threading pipe. He kept the legal pad updated: “DAY 9: replaced Ms. Kaminsky’s U-trap, she paid me in banana bread.” “DAY 17: didn’t flinch when supervisor said ‘good eye.’” “DAY 23: called Mom—talked 11 minutes, 42 seconds.”\n\nThe apartment began to change with him. He painted the walls the color of wet sand so the daylight would know where to land. He bought a second-hand table, then two chairs, because hope multiplies in even numbers. At night he practiced soldering joints under the kitchen light, the hiss of torch mixing with the hush of his held breath. Each neat bead of silver felt like a tiny weld across the cracks inside him.\n\nOn DAY 46, the landlord knocked. Marcus expected the final axe, but instead the old man carried a toolbox whose hinges squeaked like reluctant mice. “Heard you’re handy,” the landlord muttered. “Furnace in 4B is coughing. Figured you owe me labor before you owe me rent.” Marcus followed him downstairs, fixed the furnace, and walked back upstairs with a receipt marked PAID IN FULL through spring.\n\nSpring became summer. The legal pad filled, retired, and was replaced by a second, then a third. Marcus took evening classes at the community college, dragging his toolbox like a loyal dog. He learned to read blueprints the way he once read beer labels, tracing the arteries of buildings until he could see them breathing. In the hollow between semesters, he started dating the librarian who had first handed him the plumbing manuals. She smelled like paper and possibility; he told her the truth about DAY 1 over coffee, and she didn’t flinch.\n\nOne year after the eviction notice, Marcus stood in the doorway of the same apartment, now freshly re-keyed in his name. He had opened every window so the breeze carried the scent of lemon oil instead of regret. On the table rested the fourth legal pad, turned to a page that read “DAY 365.” Below it was a single sentence: “I kept the promises I wrote to myself when no one else was watching.”\n\nHe closed the door quietly, walked down the stairs, and drove to a house he was buying on the edge of town—a small place with crooked gutters and a furnace he already knew by heart. The toolbox rode shotgun; the legal pad lay on the seat like a passport stamped with everyday miracles. At a red light, Marcus glanced in the rearview mirror and saw the man he had been sitting small and surprised in the backseat, still clutching an eviction notice. Marcus nodded once, kindly, then turned his eyes to the road ahead as the light turned green and everything, at last, moved forward.", "cost": 0.002075, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title", "combination:repeat_prompt"], "kwargs": [{}, {"prompt_to_repeat": "Write a story about a man who is trying to get his life together.

It hit me so hard that I immediately thought, “Luheng needs to hear this.”\n\nWhy Lilith feels special:\n1. Atmosphere without effort – the production wraps every track in this hazy, late-night glow that makes even doing dishes feel cinematic.  \n2. Melodic storytelling – instead of verse-chorus autopilot, each song sneaks in little twists (unexpected key changes, reversed samples, whispered hooks) that reward repeat listens.  \n3. Honest contradictions – it balances vulnerability and swagger; one minute you’re floating in dreamy falsettos, the next you’re hit with a raw lyric that makes you hit rewind just to confirm what you heard.  \n4. Sequence flow – the order of the tracks feels like someone curated a night-drive playlist; you get on the on-ramp at song one and don’t want to exit until the engine turns off.  \n\nStarter route for your first spin:\n- Track 3, “Velvet Revenge,” is the gateway drug—hooks you within 10 seconds.  \n- Then jump to the back half and let Track 8, “Archives of a Ghost,” play through the city-lights-outro that segues into the closer.  \n- If you only have five minutes, the title track “Lilith” distills the whole mood into four and a half perfect minutes.\n\nLet me know which moment gives you the spine-tingle—mine happens at 2:37 of “Neon Confessional” when the bass drops out and you just hear rain on glass. I’m dying to compare notes.\n\nHappy listening!\n\nTalk soon,  \n[Your Name]\n\nP.S.

Please do not use commas in your response. Answer with more than 800 words.", "response": "The sentence is a beautiful trap. It seduces the mind with symmetry yet it dissolves under inspection. If coincidence is the mask of God then God is both present and absent at once. The very idea of anonymity implies a desire to hide yet the statement claims we can still detect the hider. A paradox appears and the heart races because paradox feels like a doorway. Human brains are pattern machines we thread separate events into single stories. When two strangers in a distant city discover they share a birthday we gasp. The gasp is pleasurable so we look for a narrator. The quote offers that narrator in the form of a hidden deity. Yet once we accept the hidden deity we must ask why such a being would bother to remain hidden. An omnipotent force could reveal itself with thunder and constant writing in the sky. Choosing instead to wink through accidents seems either coy or cruel. Therefore the quote may reveal more about human psychology than about divine strategy.\n\nArthur Schopenhauer wrote that the lowest intellect will feel metaphysical trembling when the number seven or the color red repeats in a day. He meant that trembling is cheap. Children feel it and so do gamblers. The intellect must therefore work harder to decide whether a pattern is signal or noise. When we fail to find a causal chain we still desire meaning so we invoke luck karma or providence. The quote baptizes that desire with the word God. Suddenly randomness is upgraded to intention. The upgrade feels comforting because it restores narrative order. A universe that conspires on my behalf is less indifferent than a universe of colliding atoms. Yet comfort is not evidence. One could equally say that coincidence is the devil s way of testing our rational discipline. Or that coincidence is simply the sound of large numbers rubbing against finite lives. The metaphysical label we choose says more about our emotional needs than about the structure of reality.\n\nConsider the mathematics. In a world of eight billion people any improbable event that has a one in a million chance will occur roughly eight thousand times a day. Most of those events will never reach our ears yet a few will and they will be circulated as astounding proof of hidden agency. The selection bias is colossal. We do not retell boring coincidences. A woman dreams of a golden dog and the next day her neighbor buys a golden retriever. The story spreads. Meanwhile millions wake up with no dream or with dreams that do not match reality and those stories die in silence. The net result is an anthology of miracles that grows thicker each year. The quote rides on that anthology. It offers a single poetic line to justify an entire library of anecdotes.\n\nYet the sentence is not without ethical power. If I treat each coincidence as a whisper from a hidden companion I may become more grateful more attentive more humble. The psychologist William James described a woman who felt that every bus ticket carried a message from the divine. She collected tickets and read their numbers like scripture. Her friends feared for her sanity yet she was gentle generous and unshakably cheerful. James concluded that religious experience must be judged by its fruits not by its roots. If the belief in anonymous Godly coincidences makes a person kinder then the belief is pragmatically true for that life even if no deity exists. The quote therefore functions as a spiritual technology. It rewires perception so that the world sparkles with secret intention. Sparkle is not proof but it is valuable.\n\nStill dangers lurk. A gambler who believes that a slot machine is communicating with him will empty his bank account. A political leader who sees coincidence as divine approval may launch crusades. When meaning is projected onto randomness responsibility can be offloaded onto the cosmos. The quote can thus mutate into an alibi for passivity or for atrocity. The same sentence that softens one heart can harden another. Context and character decide. Therefore the statement must never be adopted as dogma. It is a metaphor and metaphors are tools not truths.\n\nLet us probe the metaphor more deeply. The word anonymous comes from the Greek for without name. Naming is a human act. To remain anonymous is to resist human categorization. Thus the hidden deity in the quote is not merely invisible it is linguistically unreachable. Any attempt to capture it with creed or scripture fails because language is already a form of naming. The coincidence remains the only trace yet the moment we speak the trace we begin to name the origin. Paradox returns. The sentence performs the very impossibility it describes. By calling God anonymous we have already granted God a predicate and therefore a partial name. The closer we come to the silence the more we fill it with words. This is why mystics advise apophatic theology which proceeds only by negation. God is not this not that. Eventually even the negations must be negated. The quote is a popular version of that mystical move. It points toward silence then retreats into poetry.\n\nScience tells a different story. Quantum fluctuation cosmic inflation and the immense time scales of evolution provide all the randomness required for galaxies eyes and love poems to emerge. In that framework coincidence needs no author. Yet science also reveals that randomness is not the opposite of order. Given enough trials order emerges as a statistical necessity. The spiral in a sunflower and the spiral in a galaxy both follow logarithmic patterns not because a gardener shaped them both but because efficiency and entropy play the same game everywhere. Thus coincidence may be the universe s way of remaining anonymous to itself. Patterns arise without intent. The quote anthropomorphizes that self anonymity into divine stealth. The poetry is false but the intuition is half true because the universe does hide its procedures beneath counter intuitive math.\n\nIndigenous traditions complicate the issue. Many Native American narratives describe Coyote or Raven creating the world through accidental slips. The trickster god is clumsy and forgetful yet those flaws generate possibility. In such stories coincidence is not a mask it is the primary creative mode. Divinity is not hiding it is tripping over its own feet and laughing. Thus the same events that monotheism reads as secret providence are read by others as divine slapstick. The quote assumes a single serious omniscience behind the curtain yet the curtain might be a waterfall of pratfalls. Our interpretation depends on which cultural script we inherit.\n\nPersonal experience intrudes. I once missed a train that later derailed. The delay felt like mercy. I told myself that something wanted me alive. Months earlier I had missed another train that did not derail and I felt nothing. The asymmetry betrays the self centered lens through which we judge coincidence. Every survivor is a prophet in his own eyes. The dead tell no stories of the trains they caught. Therefore the quote flatters the survivor. It says you are important enough to be saved by cosmic subterfuge. Humility is advised.\n\nWe might rewrite the sentence for modern ears. Coincidence is complexity s way of exceeding our narrative bandwidth. Or Coincidence is statistics way of remaining counter intuitive. Such versions lack mystic warmth yet they invite curiosity rather than complacency. They push us toward investigation rather than resignation. Still they do not glow in the mind the way the original sentence glows. Perhaps the task is to hold both registers at once like a musical chord. We can treat the quote as a koan that destabilizes thebinary between random and willed. Each coincidence becomes an invitation to practice epistemic humility. I do not know whether this event has intention behind it yet I also admit that my knowledge is finite. The sentence then becomes a reminder of the ocean of unknown that surrounds every human life. In that sense even if no God exists the quote still succeeds. It keeps the door open.\n\nFinally there is the question of action. If I walk through the world assuming that hidden kindness is arranging synchronicities I may become more willing to cooperate with strangers. I may pay forward the gift by creating small beneficial accidents for others. The belief becomes self fulfilling. Sociologists call this the altruistic cascade. A single unexplained kindness can trigger a chain of replication. Thus even a false belief can generate real goodwill. The quote therefore should not be judged by its metaphysical accuracy but by its behavioral yield. If it makes you gentler then live inside it while remaining aware that you live inside a metaphor. Hold it lightly. When the metaphor hardens into dogma release it and seek new poetry. The universe will continue to produce coincidences whether or not we name their author. Our task is to meet those events with curiosity gratitude and responsible action.

Your adrenaline spike when the door creaks at 2 a.m.? Same hormonal cocktail that rocket-launches a zebra when it smells lion.\n\n*Love Languages Without Words*  \nHumans send heart emojis; fruit flies swap pheromones; electric fish Morse-code in volts; humpbacks sing whole operas across ocean basins. *Strip away the medium and you’re left with an identical payload: “I’m here, I’m healthy, wanna date?”* Courtship universally mixes two ingredients—showy effort and honest signal—to separate the impressive from the imposters. Whether the bouquet is roses or tail feathers, flirting is just sexting with whatever hardware evolution handed you.\n\n*Actually, We’re all Siblings*  \nSquint at the genome and the family resemblance is impossible to miss. *You share roughly 60% of your genes with a banana, 85% with a mouse, and 98.8% with the chimp politely scratching its head at the zoo.* Evolution never rebooted the operating system; it just kept patching the code.

Biology is one big open-source project, and plagiarism is encouraged.\n\nSo the next time you side-eye a pigeon waddling past your café table, remember: it frets about thermoregulation, navigates a mental map, evades the hawk overhead, tries to look sexy for the lady pigeon on the railing, and runs legacy biochemical code you both inherited.

Make sure that it's in English and not a single letter in your entire response is capitalized whatsoever.", "response": "martin van buren, eighth president of the united states, held office from march 4, 1837 to march 4, 1841. his presidency unfolded in the shadow of andrew jackson’s towering legacy, yet van buren’s own story reveals a careful architect of party politics who discovered that constructing coalitions is simpler than governing through economic storms.\n\nborn in kinderhook, new york, in 1782, van buren rose through the nuances of state politics, earning the nickname “the little magician” for his skill in crafting the democratic party’s machinery. as jackson’s secretary of state and later vice president, he absorbed old hickory’s populist style while refining the patronage system that came to be called the spoils system. when jackson chose not to seek a third term, van buren emerged as the heir apparent, winning the 1836 election against three regional whig opponents whose divided campaigns let him secure a majority in the electoral college.\n\nhe entered the white house buoyed by party unity and personal charm, but the economic fabric of the nation began to unravel within months. land speculation, lax banking practices, and the circulation of paper currency unbacked by specie created a fragile bubble. on may 10, 1837, banks in new york suspended specie payments, triggering a panic that rippled across the country. credit dried up, prices collapsed, and unemployment surged in nascent industrial cities. the downturn, remembered as the panic of 1837, defined van buren’s term and tested the young democratic party’s commitment to limited federal intervention.\n\nrefusing to revive a national bank, van buren called for a divorce of government funds from private banking altogether. he proposed the independent treasury system, a plan that would place federal money in government-run vaults, paid out only in hard currency. the idea aimed to shield public funds from risky private institutions, yet it struck many as an impractical experiment. congress resisted for two years; only in 1840, after prolonged recession, did lawmakers finally approve the scheme. even then, the benefits arrived too late to ease popular distress.\n\nbeyond finance, van buren confronted a spiraling crisis over slavery. in 1836, southern lawmakers pushed the gag rule through congress, automatically tabling antislavery petitions and stifling debate. van buren, anxious to keep the democratic coalition intact, quietly endorsed the rule, valuing party unity over moral confrontation. the decision satisfied southern allies but alienated northern reformers, foreshadowing sectional fractures that would later tear the country apart.\n\nforeign affairs offered little respite. tensions simmered along the canadian border, where an uncoordinated uprising against british rule—the rebellion of 1837—threatened to draw in american volunteers. van buren’s restraint, including the dispatch of general winfield scott to calm the frontier, averted open conflict and secured a reputation for cautious diplomacy. he also refused texas’s plea for annexation, fearing that admitting another slave state would ignite sectional strife; that controversy would await a later, less cautious administration.\n\nthe whig opposition, learning from their 1836 defeat, united behind war hero william henry harrison in 1840. they framed the campaign as a choice between the people’s candidate and the purportedly aloof, aristocratic van buren. log cabins, hard cider, and catchy slogans drowned out substantive debate. voters, battered by persisting hard times, blamed the incumbent for their woes. harrison won the electoral college by a wide margin, and van buren departed washington after a single term.\n\nhistorians have long debated van buren’s record. some see a principled steward who refused to manipulate the currency for short-term relief, thereby avoiding deeper future crises. others fault him for ideological rigidity, arguing that modest corrective action might have shortened the depression. what remains clear is that his tenure exposed the limits of jacksonian fiscal orthodoxy once speculative excesses collided with the realities of a market economy.\n\nyet van buren’s legacy extends beyond crisis management. he completed the transformation of american politics from personal factions to disciplined party organizations. his insistence on statewide conventions, party platforms, and patronage networks set templates that still shape electoral contests. after leaving office, he opposed the expansion of slavery into western territories, aligning with the free soil movement and later the republican party, demonstrating that political identities, like economies, can evolve.\n\nin the end, martin van buren’s presidency illustrates the paradox of political mastery: a man who excelled at securing power proved less adept at wielding it amid unforeseeable economic storms. his story serves as a reminder that leadership requires not only the art of coalition building but also the flexibility to adapt orthodoxies when circumstances demand.", "cost": 0.002001, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

We need € 250 k seed capital to reach break-even in month 18 and a projected EBIT of € 450 k in year 3.\n\n*Market & Trend Analysis*\nBremen’s metropolitan region counts 2.8 m inhabitants and 6 m overnight guests per year, yet no single brand offers fashion-grade, locally designed sweatshirts. Google-Trends shows a +34 % YoY rise for “Merch Bremen” and “Bremen Hoodie”. Competitors (Primark, Spreadshirt) sell generic prints; niche players (Fußball-Club merch) max out at € 35/unit with low quality. Our surveys (n = 412) reveal 68 % of 18-35-year-olds would pay € 59-79 for a premium, organic-cotton sweatshirt that tells a Bremen story.

My voice is a flute without breath. A heart must lend me wind.”  \n“Use mine,” Auraluna replied, and opened the iron gate that no siege-engine had ever dented.\n\nTogether they walked the sky-bridge of reflected starlight, footsteps ringing like glass bells.  \nBelow, the castle gardens folded into origami darkness; above, the moon grew horns of ivory flame.  \nWith every stride the dragon drew shadows out of the princess—fear of forgotten birthdays, fear of becoming a portrait before she became a story—jeweled moths that burned to soft ash mid-air.\n\nAt the summit of the night they reached the moon’s antechamber, a cratered hall where silence kept house.  \nThe dragon knelt.  \n“Place your palm upon my seventh scale; it is translucent, a window to my heart.  \nWhen you feel the drum there, speak the thing you least wish any creature to know.”\n\nAuraluna whispered, “I am lonely wearing this crown of future marble.”  \nHer words slipped through the scale like rainwater through a lantern and emerged as music—low, resonant, a cello chord struck inside a cathedral of obsidian.  \nThe moon leaned closer, listening; tides across distant oceans paused mid-breath.\n\nBut secrets traded thus demand a guardian.  \nFrom the cratered walls rose shapes of erstwhile princes and princesses who had once sought the same lullaby, now petrified into basalt statues holding blank scrolls.  \nTheir mouths opened in silent warning: To wake the dragon’s song is to anchor your own daylight forever beyond dawn.\n\nAuraluna’s pulse fluttered like a moth against lantern glass.  \n“Can I still return?” she asked.  \nThe dragon replied, “Only if you carry a piece of my night back inside your chest.  \nYou will glow softly in darkness, enough to guide others, but you yourself will never again bask in unbroken sun.”\n\nShe thought of gardens, of lemon-light brunches, of her father’s laughter echoing down marble corridors.  \nThen she thought of sleepless villagers, of cradle-bars rattling with colicky cries, of lullabies gasping for breath.  \nChoice settled over her shoulders like a cloak stitched from comet tails.\n\n“I will bear your night,” she said, and pressed her lips to the dragon’s brow.  \nA shard of obsidian night slid beneath her ribs, cool as river stone, luminous as submerged star.  \nThe statues sighed, their stone eyes closing in relief; the moon exhaled a tide of silver dust that wrapped the princess in a dress of perpetual twilight.\n\nDown they spiraled, dragon and princess, coasting on the newly born music.  \nWherever the melody brushed earth, sunflowers turned nocturnal, opening velvet faces to mirror the dark; owls sang in major keys; insomnia itself yawned, curled, slept.  \nBack atop the eastern tower, the dragon folded his wings.\n\n“Rule gently, Moon-Heart,” he said.  \n“Visit often, Night-Voice,” she answered.\n\nAt dawn, servants found Auraluna asleep on the parapet, a faint glimmer pulsing beneath her skin like a captive firefly.  \nWhen she woke she laughed—an echo of dragon-cello—and every soul within earshot fell into the sweetest slumber they had ever known.  \nIn dreams they saw a crowned girl walking a obsidian dragon across the sky, scattering sleep like seed corn.\n\nYears passed; the kingdom grew famous for rest.  \nTravelers arrived clutching pillowcases, departing with dreams embroidered in unseen thread.  \nAnd though the sun still rose, the princess never stood in its full glare; she kept to dappled courts, to twilight balconies, to libraries lit by dragon-glow.  \nYet no one called her cursed, for every night she mounted the tower and the dark shape that waited there bent its neck, and together they sang the moon down until the stars themselves replied in shimmering chords.\n\nSo the realm learned that sometimes a princess must become a lantern of darkness so her people can find the way to morning.  \nAnd if, on certain soundless midnights, you press your ear to the sky, you may still hear their duet—princess and dragon—lullabying the world to sleep, one secret, one replied promise, at a time.", "cost": 0.0021965, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "replied", "frequency": 2}], "result": true}

Separate the essay and the poem with 6 asterisk symbols: ******\nIn other words, your response should have the following form:\n[essay]\n******\n[poem]", "response": "Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston on January 17, 1706, the fifteenth of seventeen children in a modest candle-maker’s household. From the moment he slipped away from formal schooling at ten, his life became a self-directed experiment in curiosity. Apprenticed to his brother James, a printer, young Ben devoured books borrowed from tradesmen and taught himself to write by imitating the prose of Addison and Steele. When James’s sharp tongue drove Ben to seek freedom, the seventeen-year-old fled to Philadelphia with a Dutch dollar in his pocket and three rolls under his arm, stepping off the boat hungry, muddy, and instantly in love with the city he would later help invent.\n\nPhiladelphia in 1723 was a town of 6,000 souls and a thousand opportunities for a printer who could also think. Franklin became that printer, but also that thinker, turning ink into influence. He founded the Pennsylvania Gazette, then Poor Richard’s Almanack, whose aphorisms—“A penny saved is a penny earned,” “Fish and visitors stink after three days”—entered the language like coins clinking into everyday speech. Yet almanacs were only the visible ledger of a mind constantly balancing profit and public good. In 1731 he launched the Library Company, America’s first subscription library, arguing that “these libraries have improved the general conversation of the Americans.” Books, once the ornaments of the few, became tools for the many, and the electrician-printer who never patented his lightning rod or bifocals proved that ideas, like lightning, should be grounded in common welfare.\n\nScience for Franklin was never sequestered in an ivory tower; it was a civic sport. The kite flown in 1752 was not a boy’s lark but a calculation of empire: if lightning could be tamed, so could the fires that annually devoured wooden cities. Elected to the Royal Society, awarded the Copley Medal, Franklin nevertheless preferred to sign his letters “B. Franklin, printer,” insisting that titles are mere typeset, while useful knowledge is the trueboldface. He mapped the Gulf Stream, invented swim fins, charted storm paths, and still found time to coax a parlour tunes from a glass armonica, convincing Mozart and Beethoven to compose for his spinning wet fingers. Every experiment carried the same subtext: nature is addressable; address her respectfully and she will answer in practical grace.\n\nPolitics arrived as a late but inevitable edition to his life’s broadsheet. From clerk of the Pennsylvania Assembly to postmaster of Philadelphia, Franklin improved the infrastructure of dissent, quickening mail routes so that revolutionary gossip traveled at the speed of seventeen horses. Sent to London as colonial agent, he walked the gilded corridors of power in a plain brown coat, turning parliamentary contempt into satirical grenades—most famously the 1754 “Join, or Die” snake, America’s first political cartoon, urging colonies to unite against French and Native threats. When the Stamp Act riled the streets, Franklin negotiated repeal with the calm of a man who had already read tomorrow’s edition. Returning home in 1775, he helped draft the Declaration of Independence, editing Jefferson’s thunder into the precise lightning strike that history required. As minister to France he became the republican conjurer who convinced Versailles that rebelling farmers could defeat an empire, winning loans, troops, and the admiration of salons that thrilled to the paradox of a scientist who wore a coonskin cap to court.\n\nIn his final years Franklin became the republic’s kindly grandfather, presiding over the Constitutional Convention with the authority of a man who had invented more things than most nations ever try. He freed his slaves, funded schools for black children, and petitioned Congress to abolish slavery entirely—a petition tabled in a hush still echoing. Three months before his death in 1790, he finished an autobiography that refused to bow to heroics; instead he offered maxims for rising early, saving money, and keeping temper, convinced that character is the truest wealth. On April 17 he died, aged 84, surrounded by grandchildren and the smell of printer’s ink. Twenty thousand Philadelphians followed his coffin, the largest crowd the young republic had yet mustered, mourning a man who had never stopped editing the world.\n\nFranklin’s life is the template for American possibility: a runaway who became a founder, a tradesman who tutored kings, a scientist who democratized knowledge, a writer who still speaks in proverbs. He reminds us that excellence is not an accident of birth but the compound interest of daily discipline, that liberty prospers when curiosity is harnessed to conscience, and that the greatest invention any citizen can offer is an improved public square. In the towns he mapped, the libraries he seeded, the republic he helped imagine, Franklin remains the patron saint of practical idealists—those who believe that lightning can be coaxed into a gentler light, and that the printing press is merely the rehearsal for the still-unpublished edition called tomorrow.\n\n******\nInk-streaked boy, Boston-born,  \nmud-footed on Market Street—  \nyou traded candle smoke for comets,  \nset type in the dark until words struck steel.  \n\nKite of salt and regret,  \nyou tethered thunder to a key,  \ntaught fire to sleep in a rod,  \nand mailed the storm back to the king.  \n\nAlmanac sage, penny-watcher,  \nyou minted wit into common coin;  \nlibraries rose like paper cathedrals  \nwhere even apprentices could borrow the sky.  \n\nAcross the ocean you wore homespun savvy,  \na raccoon diplomat charming Versailles;  \ntheir lace learned your laugh, their debts learned your cause,  \nand revolution sailed home in French.  \n\nGrand Convention elder,  \nyou edited empires with a quill;  \nwhere others shouted, you whispered compromise  \nuntil the Constitution breathed.  \n\nLast light at Franklin’s window,  \nyou inked an apology to tomorrow:  \n“Do thou scrap the chains I could not break—  \nI die, but the experiment continues.”", "cost": 0.002545, "instruction_id_list": ["combination:two_responses"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

{"id": 179, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "A filmmaker is trying to get financing for a film about the history of the Internet. Write an essay to be used in the proposal to potential investors. The essay should be at least 50 sentences long.", "response": "The Internet did not begin with a bang but with a quiet handshake in a UCLA lab on October 29, 1969, when the letters “L” and “O” traveled 350 miles before the system crashed—an anticlimactic moment that nonetheless birthed the most transformative technology since the printing press.  Our film, “Lo and Behold: The Secret History of the Internet,” will re-create that flicker of green text on a monochrome screen and then sprint forward across six decades, showing how a Defense Department failsafe became the oxygen of modern civilization.  Investors are rightfully skeptical of technology documentaries; too many are cloaked in jargon or hagiography.  We propose the opposite: a character-driven thriller whose protagonists are hippies, generals, teenagers, and tycoons, each clutching a piece of the same infinite puzzle.  The story opens in the era of Kennedy, when the perceived missile gap drove ARPA to fund a network that could survive nuclear holocaust; we will stage this Cold War anxiety with crisp black-and-white cinematography, the hum of mainframes underscored by a analog-synth score that throbs like a submarine sonar.  From there we vault to the Stanford labs where Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn argue over coffee-stained napkins about packet-switching, their dialogue lifted verbatim from newly declassified memos that we have permission to reveal on screen for the first time.  We will cast rising indie actors rather than stars, because the emotional core of this narrative is not fame but obsession; we want viewers to feel the sleepless nights, the solder burns, the terror of being first.  The budget we seek is $18.5 million, a figure that sounds large until one realizes that the average tech-company commercial during the Super Bowl costs twice as much and is forgotten within a week; our film will last forever, licensed to streamers, museums, and every high-school library on the planet.  Distribution is pre-secured with HBO Documentary Films for North America and Netflix for global streaming; what we need now is finishing equity to shoot dramatic re-creations in five countries, license 300 archival clips, and animate 40 minutes of code traveling through fiber-optic cables at the speed of light.  The unprecedented access we have already obtained includes exclusive interviews with Tim Berners-Lee, who will walk us through the NeXT computer on which he wrote the World Wide Web, and radical activist Pia Mancini, who explains why the same protocols that share cat videos also toppled dictators during the Arab Spring.  Visually, the film will alternate between hyper-stylized tableaux—rows of face-lit hackers in 1980s basements—and stark, vérité sequences inside the bullet-proof data centers that now house the cloud, creating a cinematic dialectic between myth and machinery.  Revenue projections conservatively place worldwide lifetime receipts at $42 million; the comparable film “The Social Network” earned $224 million, but that was fiction.  Our advantage is truth, and truth travels farther now that every viewer carries a router in their pocket.  The merchandising tail is longer than typical documentary fare: a companion book negotiated with Penguin Random House, a 10-part podcast sponsored by Mozilla, and an educational VR experience that lets students stand inside the CERN corridor where the Web was born.  The ask is divided into equity shares of $250,000 each, with a 120% recoupment waterfall before backend, ensuring that cash flows begin six months after streaming release, not the customary eighteen.  We have attached an Oscar-winning editor who cut “Searching for Sugar Man” and a composer who scored “Stranger Things,” guaranteeing both pedigree and viral appeal.  The film’s release strategy culminates in a global ‘Internet Shutdown Day’ publicity stunt, where theaters stream the film for free for 24 hours, driving demand for the premium extended cut; sponsors like Cloudflare and theMozilla Foundation have pledged six-figure activation budgets to amplify the event.  But beneath the numbers lies a moral urgency: if we do not chronicle this saga now, the pioneers will be gone, their floppy disks turned to dust, and all that will remain are the sanitized legends crafted by the victors who monetized the commons.  We want to humanize the geeks who coded in assembly language while the world slept, to show that innovation is not a TED Talk but a messy, terrifying leap into the dark.  Consider Radia Perlman, whose Spanning Tree Algorithm quietly saves every Ethernet packet you send; we will stage her as a mythic figure striding through a redwood forest of routers, because poetry is the only way the general public will ever remember her name.  Consider the fiber-optic cables that lie across the ocean floor, and the 300,000-mile journey one email takes from Lagos to London; we will miniature-map this underwater pilgrimage with macro lenses and bioluminescent dyes, turning infrastructure into cosmos.  The film will also confront the abyss: the darknet markets, the harassment, the microscopic attention span of a generation raised on dopamine loops.  We will interview the parents whose teenager live-streamed her suicide, and the moderator in Manila who deletes 25,000 beheading videos per month; their testimony will be intercut with vintage 1990s AOL ads whose chirpy optimism now feels like propaganda.  Yet despair is not the destination; the third act arcs toward possibility—community mesh networks in Detroit, blockchain land registries in Nairobi, a 12-year-old girl in Seoul who learned English by watching BTS tweets and now codes AI that diagnoses cataracts.  The cinematic grammar will evolve alongside its subject:的镜头 start in 16-mm film grain, transition to pixelated Betacam, bloom into 4K digital, and finally dissolve into vertical-frame cellphone footage, so that the form of the movie enacts the very acceleration it chronicles.  Every frame will be shot native 8K, future-proofing against iterations of VR and holo-table viewing that even Netflix has not yet rolled out.  Our legal team has already cleared rights to 2,000 archival assets, including the 1993 “We are the Web” photo of the Mosaic team barefoot on a University of Illinois lawn, an image as iconic as the Iwo Jima flag-raising for the digital age.  We have partnered with the Internet Archive, whose founder Brewster Kahle has agreed to let us stage a dramatic crane shot inside the former Christian Science church that now stores 70 petabytes of human knowledge.  Kahle will narrate the epilogue live from that sanctuary, arguing that the Internet is the first library that can dream, and that if we forget how it was built we will lose the instruction manual for our collective soul.  The COVID-19 pandemic proved that connectivity is no longer luxury but oxygen; audiences who once rolled their eyes at IP addresses now lean forward, hungry to understand why their grandmother’s funeral happened on Zoom.  That hunger translates to market demand: Wikipedia page views for “DNS” spiked 800% the week Facebook went dark for six hours in 2021, and our film will ride that same wave of bewildered curiosity.  We have retained Hot Docs’ award-winning impact producers to ensure the movie becomes a semester syllabus in 500 universities, a revenue stream that scales through licensing rather than ticket sales alone.  The production timeline is 18 months, with principal photography clustered into three 30-day blocks to accommodate interview subjects who refuse to leave their pandemic bunkers; travel budgets have been cushioned by private plane share agreements with three climate-tech startups eager to offset carbon by sponsoring the first carbon-neutral technology documentary.  Every investor will receive a blockchain-verified NFT that unlocks a private Discord channel where the director posts dailies, turning financing into fan-building months before release.  But the true return on investment is cultural immortality; your grandchildren will not ask if you optioned another rom-com, they will ask whether you helped chronicle the moment when humanity merged with its machines.  We close the film with a single shot: a dilapidated modem from 1983, its beige plastic yellowed, blinking forlornly in a landfill while thousands of satellites overhead beam TikTok dances to every corner of the globe.  That juxtaposition is the encapsulation of our tale—how yesterday’s trash became today’s sky.  Investors who climb aboard now will see their logos appear beside the credits that read “This film was made possible by pioneers who understood that stories, like packets, must travel fast before they dissolve.”  The Internet was not inevitable; it was willed into existence by visionaries who risked reputation, marriage, and mental health so that strangers could argue in real time about whether a dress was blue or gold.  Their saga is the founding myth of our century, and myths need capital the way code needs electricity.  Give us the volts, and we will give the world the first great epic poem about the infinite library we all now inhabit, a story so urgent that even the buffering wheel becomes a cliffhanger.  The choice is simple: you can fund another forgettable franchise, or you can cement your name to the moment when cinema finally meets the cloud and tells the oldest story—how human beings, armed only with curiosity, wired the planet and accidentally found themselves.", "cost": 0.0038989999999999997, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 50}], "result": false}

Out stumbled seven neon-green beings who looked like sentient gummy bears wearing skinny jeans. Their leader, Zorp, announced via interpretive dance that they had conquered seventeen galaxies but still couldn’t stream the final season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” without buffering. Consequently, Earth was now property of the Galactic Empire until someone produced the password “PROBEVODKA2025” in under thirty seconds.  \n\\n\\n\nHumanity responded with the calm coordination of a middle-school fire drill.

The stock market briefly soared on news that interstellar venture capitalists were considering Earth for a Series A round, then plummeted when Zorp revealed his portfolio was 96% NFTs of cats wearing crocs. Meanwhile, the aliens sampled Earth’s cuisine, declared LaCroix “carbonated despair,” and retaliated by replacing every billboard on I-95 with a looping GIF of a disappointed extraterrestrial shaking its head.  \n\\n\\n\nDesperate negotiations moved to a Dave & Buster’s in suburban Atlanta where Earth’s delegates—three DMV employees on their lunch break—offered unlimited tokens and a counterfeit Jurassic Park jeep ride in exchange for planetary sovereignty. The aliens counter-demanded one working Roomba and a zip file containing every unreleased Beyoncé track. Talks stalled when someone’s Groupon expired mid-deal and the capybara ate the last plate of loaded potato skins, prompting Zorp to call humans “a disappointing species that can’t even multitask apps correctly.”  \n\\n\\n\nUltimately the aliens departed at sundown, citing “cosmic boredom” and an inability to locate a Starbucks that still carried the pumpkin loaf. Before liftoff they beamed Earth a final message: “Call us when you’ve invented a router that doesn’t need unplugging twice a day.” The taco truck vanished in a glittery burp, leaving behind only a glowing sticky note reading “Your Yelp review is 2 stars—decent salsa, planet too clingy.” President Fluffkick immediately signed an executive order renaming Tuesdays “Galactic Taco Tuesdays” and allocated $40 trillion toward developing router technology that even grandmothers can troubleshoot, proving once again that humanity’s greatest talent is missing the point while making it a federal holiday.", "cost": 0.001357, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "president", "num_paragraphs": 6, "nth_paragraph": 2}], "result": false}

He told me to pour coke on it and then scrub it with a steel wool. Is this a good way to remove rust? Respond with at least 20 sentences and have more than 4 words be in all capital letters.", "response": "Pouring COKE on a rusty bike chain and attacking it with STEEL WOOL is a method that has made the rounds in playgrounds and online forums for decades, but it is FAR from the best way to care for your drivetrain.  \nFirst, the phosphoric acid in Coca-Cola CAN dissolve some surface oxidation, yet the same acid will also creep into the micro-fissures of the metal and promote new corrosion once the sticky sugar residue is left behind.  \nSecond, STEEL WOOL, especially the medium or coarse grades, is absolutely BRUTAL to the sensitive side plates and rollers of a bicycle chain; it leaves thousands of tiny scratches that become new homes for rust and it strips away the factory anti-corrosion coatings that manufacturers work hard to apply.  \nThird, the sugar, caramel coloring, and other additives in COKE dry into a gunky film that attracts road grit like a magnet, turning your freshly “cleaned” chain into a self-cheating sandpaper loop that grinds away at every expensive cassette tooth and chainring.  \nFourth, the whole process is MESSY: you end up with a dark, sticky puddle on the floor, syrupy droplets on your rims, and a driveway that will attract ants and bees for weeks.  \nFifth, it is TIME-INEFFICIENT: you will spend more time scrubbing, rinsing, and re-scrubbing than you would with a purpose-made product that works in minutes.  \nSixth, the environmental angle matters: phosphoric acid is not catastrophic, but dumping sugar-laden, metal-shard-filled coke into the gutter is definitely NOT eco-friendly compared with using a biodegradable degreaser.  \nSeventh, safety is often ignored: STEEL WOOL can shed slivers that end up in your fingers, and if you accidentally hit the chain while turning the crank you can slice a knuckle faster than you can say “tetanus shot.”  \nEighth, the myth originated because old-school cans of Coke contained more phosphoric acid than today's formula, so the anecdotal “it worked for my uncle in 1985” story is based on a beverage that no longer exists in the same concentration.  \nNinth, modern chains are often nickel-plated or even partially stainless; those thin platings are easily scrubbed off by aggressive abrasion, exposing the underlying high-carbon steel which rusts EVEN faster.  \nTenth, the internal pins and bushings of a chain are the most critical parts, yet coke and steel wool only clean the outer faces, leaving hidden corrosion to spread unseen until your chain starts skipping under load.  \nEleventh, if you let the Coke sit for “just five minutes” you get a patchy, inconsistent result, but if you let it soak overnight you wake up to a chain that is tacky, smelling like a movie theater, and still only halfway derusted.  \nTwelfth, you will STILL need to rinse, dry, and oil the chain afterward, and the rinse water will be brown, sticky, and full of steel-wool fibers that can clog your drain.  \nThirteenth, there is a far SUPERIOR method that costs only a few dollars and protects rather than wounds your components: remove the chain with a master link tool, drop it into a cheap plastic bottle half-filled with a dedicated biodegradable degreaser, shake for two minutes, let it soak while you drink a coffee, then rinse, dry, and apply a proper bicycle-specific chain lube.  \nFourteenth, if the rust is light surface orange freckling, you can often skip abrasives altogether: spray on a rust-eating gel like Evapo-Rust or Metal Rescue, wait 15 minutes, rinse, dry, and lube; those products are non-toxic, reusable, and they leave the anti-corrosion film intact.  \nFifteenth, for heavy, flaky rust that has already pitted the links, honestly the smartest move is to measure the chain for wear with a $10 chain-wear tool; if it is beyond 0.5 % elongation, no amount of Coke or steel wool will restore the lost structural integrity, so replace the chain BEFORE it devours your cassette and chainrings.  \nSixteenth, prevention beats restoration every time: after wet rides, wipe the chain dry, apply a wet-lube rated for your climate, and spin the cranks a few revolutions to push the lubricant into the internals; this 60-second ritual will save you hours of futile scrubbing.  \nSeventeenth, storage matters too: keep the bike in a dry spot, and if you live near the ocean or in a humid basement, slip a breathable cover over the drivetrain and toss a few silica-gel packs near the cassette to absorb airborne moisture.  \nEighteenth, if you absolutely must MacGyver something on tour and only have grocery-store options, skip the Coke: instead, dunk the chain in boiling water mixed with a spoonful of citric acid (sold as sour salt in the baking aisle), agitate with an old toothbrush, rinse, dry, and oil; citric acid is gentler, less sticky, and just as cheap.  \nNineteenth, remember that a bike chain is a high-tensile, high-precision part that transmits every watt of your power to the road; treating it like a rusty barn nail with a folk-remedy hack is the cycling equivalent of washing your eyeglasses with sandpaper—technically you remove the grime, but you also ruin the tool you depend on.  \nTwentieth, in SHORT: STEP AWAY from the COKE can, retire the STEEL WOOL, and give your chain the same respect you give your tires, your helmet, or your knees—use purpose-made cleaners, measure wear intelligently, lube little but often, and your drivetrain will whisper quiet miles instead of sounding like a squeaky horror movie prop.", "cost": 0.002477, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 20}, {"capital_relation": "at least", "capital_frequency": 5}], "result": false}

Once the gross amounts are tallied, you can subtract “above-the-line” deductions such as traditional IRA contributions, student-loan interest, and one-half of self-employment tax to arrive at your adjusted gross income (AGI). From the AGI, choose either the standard deduction or itemized deductions (Schedule A) and, if eligible, apply any “below-the-line” adjustments like the qualified business income deduction (Section 199A). The result is your taxable income, which you then slot into the appropriate IRS tax brackets to determine your gross tax liability; subtract any tax credits (child, earned income, education, etc.) and any withholding or estimated payments you already made, and you will calculate the final balance due or refund owed.\n\n***\n\nAfter you know the bottom-line numbers, you must file your return by submitting the correct forms to the Internal Revenue Service before the April deadline (or the October extended deadline if you file Form 4868). Most taxpayers e-file through IRS-approved software or a tax professional, which reduces math errors and speeds refunds; if your AGI is below a set threshold, you can use Free File. Attach all necessary schedules—Schedule 1 for extra income/adjustments, Schedule 2 for additional taxes, Schedule 3 for extra credits, and Schedule C or F for business/farm income—and include payment voucher Form 1040-V if you owe tax you cannot pay online. If you cannot pay in full, you may request an installment agreement online; the key is to file on time even if you can’t pay immediately, because the failure-to-file penalty is ten times harsher than the failure-to-pay penalty.\n\n***\n\nIn conclusion, mastering taxes is less about memorizing every line of the tax code and more about systematically collecting documents, using IRS-approved tools to calculate correctly, and meeting the annual obligation to file on time. Keep a year-round folder for W-2s, 1099s, receipts, and letters so next April’s process feels routine rather than frantic.

the floor answers with hidden sub-bass that travels up spines instead of ears.  \nA woman in row three feels her broken molar vibrate, tastes iron, and decides the night has already paid for itself.  \nHe has no mic, no instrument, only the costume of shadow and a pair of shoes cobbled from mirror shards.  \nWhen he turns, the mirrors catch every face in the hall, fracturing them into kaleidoscopic confessions.  \nChildren see themselves as future giants; retirees see the children they never had; the ushers see only exits.  \nHe begins to speak in a language no one knows, yet every sentence lands like a recalled dream.  \nThe syntax is a staircase; nouns are doors; verbs are windows suddenly flung open on a storm.  \nHalfway up the linguistic staircase he removes his jacket, revealing arms tattooed with obsolete maps.  \nA shipping route across his forearm begins to bleed real salt water, dripping steadily onto the stage.  \nThe droplets hiss, become steam, rise, condense on the rafters, and fall again as micro-rain on the first balcony.  \nNo one opens umbrellas; they open their mouths, tasting childhood summers in each drop.  \nHe pauses, listens to the rain, then snaps his fingers so time folds like bad origami.  \nSuddenly everyone remembers they once knew how to fly but agreed to forget for social convenience.  \nFlight memories ache like phantom wings; shoulder blades itch, jackets slip, and several people stand.  \nSecurity guards feel the insult of gravity personally and let the standing stay standing.  \nHe bows to the guards, acknowledging their temporary unemployment by wonder.  \nThe stage spins slowly, a turntable powered by rumor and the crank of collective breath.  \nWith each revolution, the performer's age oscillates: twenty, sixty, twelve, deathless.  \nAt the twelve-year-old rotation, a boy in the audience recognizes his own lost freckles and sobs permission.  \nAt the sixty-year-old rotation, an elderly man releases the hand of the stranger he has been clinging to since intermission.  \nAt the deathless rotation, nobody blinks; they store the image behind their eyelids for future hospice nights.  \nHe produces a deck of cards that are blank on both sides, offers them to the front row for inspection.  \nA teenage skeptic chews the edge of one card, tasting only impossible mint.  \nThe man fans the blanks, exhales, and every card blooms into handwritten letters addressed to members of the crowd.  \nThe first letter is a grocery list a mother wrote the week she died; her son, now sixty, hears her again in the crinkle of paper.  \nThe second letter is a breakup note never sent; the intended recipient, present by accident, falls in love with the sender’s younger ghost.  \nThe third letter is a permission slip for someone to stop being brave; a war veteran stands, salutes the stage, and sits lighter.  \nHe shuffles the now-illustrated deck into the air where it becomes a flock of paper cranes that refuse to fly in formation.  \nThe cranes peck at the violet lights, replacing each bulb with a star harvested from an unused future.  \nConstellations rewrite themselves across the ceiling: a teacup, a subway map, a hospital bracelet.  \nAudience members later swear Orion’s belt appeared momentarily as a row of auditorium seats.  \nHe claps once; the stars implode into silver dust that settles on hair and shoulders like dandruff from the moon.  \nPeople will brush it off in the morning, find their mirrors missing, and spend the day inventing new reflections.  \nHe next removes a shoe, pours from it a ribbon of sand that forms a perfect hourglass on the floor without glass.  \nThe sand flows upward, reversing entropy for fifty-eight seconds while university physicists quietly update notes.  \nChildren count the seconds in hiccups; the hiccups echo, become laughing seagulls nobody has the heart to shush.  \nHe invites the seagulls to perch on sentences he speaks, turning each word white with guano of forgotten languages.  \nUnder the weight, words drop from the air, break open, release tiny music boxes that play the sound of knees hitting carpet in prayer.  \nAn atheist kneels anyway, claiming he is only tying philosophical shoelaces.  \nA priest kneels beside him, confessing he has been faking belief in shoes.  \nThey laugh in harmony, creating a chord that makes the sand stop mid-climb, suspended like a question mark.  \nHe bows to the chord, records it on a gramophone that materializes from the heat of shared epiphanies.  \nThe vinyl is black ice; the needle is a fingernail he grows on demand, curling like a cat tail.  \nAs the record plays, every mistake the audience ever made is remastered into a bridge of forgiven sound.  \nCouples cross the bridge holding hands that are no longer theirs; exes exchange fingers like phone numbers.  \nThe performer watches, eyes reflecting the bridge upside down, making crossing look like ascension.  \nWhen the last person steps off, the bridge melts into a puddle that mirrors only the sky at 3 a.m.  \nHe invites volunteers to skip stones across the puddle; the stones are their pulse rates, flat and skippable.  \nSeven skips grant a wish nobody can name but everyone will remember receiving during tax season.  \nHe counts the skips aloud in prime numbers, voice cracking on 53, the age his father never reached.  \nA hush shaped like an unspoken apology passes between complete strangers who suddenly share genes of grief.  \nTo break the hush, he swallows the remaining violet light, digesting it into bioluminescent veins that glow through translucent skin.  \nNow semi-transparent, he walks to the edge of the stage, offers his glowing body as a lantern for the trip home.  \nOne by one, audience members tear small squares of his shirt, pocketing pieces that stay lit like safety matches against Monday.  \nBy the time the last square is gone, he is shirtless but not cold; the lobby thermometer rises in solidarity.  \nHe bows once more, this time to the empty air where the crowd used to be; seats fold themselves into paper airplanes.  \nThe airplanes glide to the stage, land in a neat pile, become the script for tomorrow’s show nobody will remember buying tickets to.  \nHe picks up the script, hides it inside the hollow of his neck where the violet light once lived.  \nThe curtain falls, or perhaps the building simply exhales, and the stage is dark, save for a single mirror shard still glittering in his shoe.", "cost": 0.0030174999999999998, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 60}, {"relation": "less than", "num_words": 600}], "result": false}

Your response should contain at least 30 sentences and exactly 2 bullet points. Also, it must contain at least 8 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address]. Use the bullet points like:\n* This is a bullet point", "response": "The assertion that wizards are inherently more powerful than sorcerers because they study magic rather than being born with it is a fascinating topic that has sparked countless debates in magical academies across [continent]. This perspective suggests that deliberate, scholarly acquisition of arcane knowledge produces a superior practitioner compared to someone whose abilities manifest spontaneously. When we examine the curriculum at [prestigious academy], we find that wizards undergo rigorous training in [complex spell theory] that allows them to understand the fundamental principles governing magical phenomena. Their approach to magic is analytical, methodical, and based on centuries of accumulated knowledge recorded in [ancient grimoire] after [ancient grimoire]. This systematic study enables them to manipulate magical energies with precision, often creating new spells or variations through careful experimentation in [laboratory] settings. The wizard's power grows through dedication, late nights poring over [dusty tome] collections, and the disciplined practice of [arcane gesture] sequences until they become second nature. In contrast, sorcerers draw their magic from innate sources such as draconic heritage, wild magic, or divine touches that occurred during [formative event] periods of their lives. Their abilities manifest spontaneously, often surprising the sorcerer themselves with sudden [magical manifestation] that can range from beneficial to catastrophically uncontrolled. This natural gift allows sorcerers to cast spells without the material components or lengthy preparation that wizards require, making them invaluable in situations where immediate magical response is crucial. The sorcerer's connection to their magical source is intuitive, emotional, and deeply personal, often tied to [ancestral memory] or [cosmic accident] that forever altered their spiritual DNA. However, this same intuitive approach can limit a sorcerer's versatility, as they typically master fewer spells than their wizard counterparts but can cast them more frequently through [innate reservoir] of magical energy. The debate becomes more nuanced when we consider that power in magic isn't solely determined by the source of one's abilities but also by creativity, experience, and the specific [magical crisis] at hand. A wizard might spend years mastering the perfect [fire spell] formula, while a sorcerer might spontaneously generate the same effect through raw emotional intensity during [life-threatening moment]. The wizard's advantage lies in their ability to adapt, combining multiple schools of magic to create [hybrid effect] that no single innate ability could produce. They can prepare different spells each day based on anticipated challenges, carrying [component pouch] filled with carefully gathered materials that enable them to cast [ritual spell] with effects that can reshape reality itself. The sorcerer's strength manifests in their resilience and flexibility during actual combat, where they can apply [metamagic technique] to enhance their spells on the fly, turning a simple [energy burst] into a devastating [amplified blast] that can cleave through enemy ranks. Historical records from [magical war] show that wizard battalions could maintain long-term magical siege operations, while sorcerer strike teams excelled at rapid, unpredictable assaults that disrupted enemy formations. The most compelling arguments against the supremacy of studied magic emerge when we examine [legendary sorcerer] figures whose raw power reshaped nations, sometimes accidentally, demonstrating that innate ability can reach heights that systematic study might never achieve. Conversely, [archmage name] stands as testament to wizardly achievement, having developed [breakthrough spell] that fundamentally altered how magic is understood across [magical society]. The philosophical divide extends beyond practical applications to questions of identity and authenticity in magical practice. Wizards often view their journey as a [hero's quest] for knowledge, believing that each [spell mastered] brings them closer to cosmic understanding. Sorcerers frequently struggle with [identity crisis], questioning whether their abilities define them or if they can transcend their [magical inheritance] to become something more. The emotional toll differs significantly between paths, with wizards facing [existential doubt] when experiments fail, while sorcerers grapple with [loss of control] that can result in [magical catastrophe] affecting innocent bystanders. Modern magical theory suggests that the most powerful practitioners combine both approaches, beginning with [innate talent] that they then refine through [rigorous study], creating [synthesis path] that transcends traditional limitations. The [magical council] of [major city] has documented cases where [hybrid practitioners] achieve effects impossible for either pure wizards or sorcerers alone, though such individuals are rare and often face [prejudice] from both communities. Environmental factors also influence the debate, as [ley line] convergence can amplify sorcerer abilities while [anti-magic field] renders wizard spells useless if they haven't prepared [contingency plan]. The economic aspect cannot be ignored, as wizard training requires significant investment in [tuition fees] and [material cost], while sorcerers must often hire [control tutor] to prevent [magical accident] that could destroy their livelihood. Cultural perspectives vary dramatically across [multiverse region], where [shamanic tradition] views both approaches as equally valid paths to [spiritual enlightenment], while [technocratic society] exclusively values wizardry as [scientific discipline]. The temporal dimension adds another layer, as sorcerers reach [power plateau] early in life but may struggle to progress further, whereas wizards experience [gradual ascension] that can continue indefinitely with sufficient [lifespan extension]. The ethical implications differ substantially, with wizards held accountable for [knowledge misuse] they should have anticipated through study, while sorcerers face [moral judgment] for failing to control abilities they never chose to possess. Recent developments in [magical research] suggest that the distinction between innate and studied magic may be artificial, as both ultimately manipulate the same [universal force] through different [cognitive interface] mechanisms. The [prophecy archive] contains predictions that future magical evolution will blur these lines entirely, creating [new breed] of practitioners who seamlessly integrate [intuitive casting] with [analytical framework]. Perhaps the most important consideration is that power itself is contextual, with [social influence], [political connection], and [moral conviction] often proving more decisive than raw magical ability in determining [historical outcome]. The greatest [magical villain] in recorded history was a wizard whose [superior knowledge] enabled [catastrophic spell], while the [savior of realm] was a sorcerer whose [spontaneous act] prevented [apocalyptic scenario], suggesting that morality and choice transcend methodological origins. In conclusion, the question of whether wizards are more powerful than sorcerers reduces a complex, multifaceted reality into an overly simplistic binary that fails to capture the rich tapestry of magical practice. True power lies not in the source of one's abilities but in how they are applied, the wisdom to know when to use them, and the courage to accept responsibility for their consequences. The most enlightened magical communities now recognize that diversity in magical approaches strengthens their collective capability, moving beyond [outdated paradigm] toward [inclusive framework] that values contribution over origin.\n\n* The assertion that study inherently produces superior magical power fails to account for the [revolutionary discovery] made by [famous sorcerer] whose [instant comprehension] of [ chaotic resonance] principles led to [breakthrough technique] that wizards had overlooked for centuries despite their [exhaustive research], demonstrating that intuitive connection can sometimes access [deeper truth] that analytical methods miss entirely.\n\n* When evaluating magical power, we must consider that [sorcerer flexibility] in combat situations allows for [adaptive response] that can neutralize even [masterfully prepared] wizard spells, as evidenced during [historic duel] where [sorcerer name] defeated [archmage title] by spontaneously modifying [energy signature] to bypass [ward configuration] that had taken the wizard [decade] to perfect, proving that [innate intuition] can overcome [systematic advantage] under the right [circumstantial pressure].", "cost": 0.0033435, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "detectable_format:number_bullet_lists", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}, {"num_bullets": 2}, {"num_placeholders": 8}], "result": true}

Paired with charcoal trousers that refuse to wrinkle even after a 14-hour docket, the magistrates now glide rather than walk, their robes evaporating into history like an outdated precedent.\n\n* The hem of every new robe contains a conductive ribbon that syncs with the courthouse’s smart-gavel system, automatically logging each strike to an immutable blockchain ledger—no more “lost” minutes, no more debates over what the record shows.\n\n* Built-in AR lenses allow judges to summon case law in their peripheral vision, overlaying prior rulings onto the present scene without ever breaking eye contact with the witness who needs to feel seen.\n\n* A concealed panic stitch—dyed the exact same shade as the fabric—deploys a privacy veil across the upper torso when cameras encroach, protecting the dignity of juvenile defendants while remaining invisible to the naked eye.\n\nReactions have been predictably split. Young clerks call the ensemble “Judge Dredd meets Dior”; veteran attorneys mutter about tradition abandoned like an orphan statute. Yet the numbers speak louder than nostalgia: motion-to-dismiss times have dropped 18 % since the rollout, and surveys reveal that self-represented litigants feel 34 % less intimidated when the person on the bench looks ready to listen instead of ready to lecture. Even the bailiffs admit the new silhouette makes it easier to spot the judge in a crowded hallway, reducing the awkward chorus of “Judge on the floor!” that once echoed through every coffee break.\n\nP.S.

Every hearth was lit at dusk, every child recited the same morning rhyme, and conversations hemmed themselves inside comfortable borders. Among these dwellers drifted cartographer-orphan Elen, quiet but watchful. She was tolerated because maps were useful, yet her claim—\"REALITY stretches beyond the lines we draw\"—was but tolerated as fancy.  \n\nOne autumn noon, an anxious WARNING rattled market stalls: the river, annual provider of fish and ferry-trade, had sunk overnight. Not dried, not dammed—simply lowered, unveiling a staircase of black stones running downstream. Whispers panicked: drought omen, angry spirit, curse. The elders posted guards to peer at the water’s retreat, and Elen volunteered for the last shift because investigators avoided the moonless hours.  \n\nShe sat on a muddied bank, lantern low. Around midnight she heard a sigh, half-bubble, half-whisper, sliding between bare rocks. The staircase, slick as obsidian, carried faint glyphs. Heart racing, she stepped onto the first slab. Water seeped up ankle-high, only above the carved letters, revealing a language older than settlement. She traced the symbol for PATH. The slab brightened; the river obeyed the text, NOT her fear.  \n\nThree descents onward she found a chamber open to subterranean air. Inside, an iron ring held a parchment sealed in wax. Breaking it released an UNEASY scent of cedar. Drawn there was an inverse map of Littledale—streets curling inward, forest squares where fields lay, river reversed beneath mountain—and written across the margin: \"WHAT IS PLAIN IS BUT A SCENE; TRUTH LIES IN THE NEGATIVE SPACE.\"  \n\nShe climbed back before dawn, heart pounding with URGENCY yet cloaked in calm. The elders demanded answers; she presented the map. They scoffed: \"Riddles!\" Merchants feared talk of hidden depths would sink trade further. Heads shook; eyes narrowed. Only the carpenter’s apprentice, Thom, noticed Elen’s lantern shaking, not from cold but conviction.  \n\nOver weeks the river stayed lowered; barges jammed, tempers flared. Elen paced, arguing truths were being ignored, but COUNTER voices chanted safety in the familiar. One night, frustrated, she asked Thom if fear of IMPACT was stronger than hunger for knowledge. Thom hesitated, then confessed he had once spotted roots of village oak running uphill, defying gravity—evidence that foundations, like facts, sometimes invert. They formed a silent pact to follow the black-stair map further.  \n\nEquipped with chalk, bread, and COURAGE, they traced each misprinted landmark’s opposite position. Where the parchment showed a hollow square behind the granary, they dug, expecting nothing. Their shovels hit timber: a sealed trunk containing seed-pouches dated fifty summers prior, labeled in an elder’s hand who had preached river immortality. Seeds sprouted when wet, feeding livestock fodder during floods. The elders, frantic to keep granaries sacrosanct, had hidden surplus then engineered legend of endless plenty to control share.  \n\nNews of the trunk leaked; villagers felt betrayal twist their stomachs harder than any drought. But revelation bred reflection: if food security had been manipulated, what other narratives were varnished? Elen, trembling from WORRY more than triumph, gathered council at the staircase. She laid the inverse map beside common map, inviting them to overlay. Conflicts aligned: crop failures, land feuds, even missing heirlooms fell perfectly onto blank zones of parchment. Hidden histories surfaced; people realized discomfort had been painted over for generations, anxiety pacified by denial.  \n\nA meeting stretched through dusk, voices low but no longer accusatory. The river, sensing perhaps its own liberation, began rising, first inch, then foot, flooding the glyphs yet leaving stones warm beneath current. Children splashed, collecting driftwood in shapes of un-drawn streets. Elders wept, not for vanishing authority but for SUDDEN vista of honesty.  \n\nIn aftermath Littledale changed—not overnight, but season by season. Maps were redrawn to include negative spaces, and youth trained to read void as value. Elen’s title shifted from tolerated orphan to Keeper of the Overlooked. She still walked banks nightly, lantern in hand, aware that every plateau of calm masked a cavern underneath, that every accepted norm invites excavation. And when storms rattle shutters or market gossip turns fevered, someone would recall the river staircase, whisper a reminder tinged with awe at how much life hinges on what is not obvious, and how CRUCIAL it is to keep listening for the half-bubble, half-whisper that invites us downward into truth.", "cost": 0.0020555, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:capital_word_frequency"], "kwargs": [{"capital_relation": "less than", "capital_frequency": 20}], "result": true}

I pick one at the end, a wooden parel of scratches and burnt crescents from odd smokes.  \nAgnes, the barkeep, nods.  \nAgnes: “Evenin’, stranger.

Rumor leaks that folks come here to trade pain for plot.”  \nMan: “We neither barter nor bargain. Memory drags that cart alone.”  \nRen lifts a brow, then slumps back toward a count of distant months.  \n\nHank’s tune ends. Bartenders clap for a short burst, half jest, half mercy.  \nAgnes leans close.  \nAgnes: “Toward dawn she’d want your face held high.”  \nMan: “Dawn can’t have what Eve tore away.”  \nAgnes touches my glass, softly drumming.  \nAgnes: “Light wades. Try to float.”  \n\nI listen, though ears keep crackle of a smash, a scream, a wheel, a warped chrome car.  \nSorrow wakes in months, not days.  \nRye slams the chest, but sorrow stays afloat.  \n\nRen turns again.  \nRen: “Need a second set of hands?”  \nMan: “Got two already; no more arms would help.”  \nRen chuckles, almost earnest.  \nRen: “Company?”  \nMan: “Aye… though the math ends at company of one.”  \nWe tap our glasses; one soft clap echoes, a gentle pact between two dents.  \n\nAgnes cuts lamps, one hue at a time.  \nPatrons exhale outside; exhaust from old trucks forms ghosts upon the frost.  \nAgnes: “Last call!”  \nMan: “Hold on.”  \nI swivel, gaze at burn marks.

Make sure your entire response is wrapped in double quotation marks.", "response": "\"IBM’s 1956 chess program—generally credited to Alex Bernstein, Michael de V. Roberts, and their colleagues working on the IBM 704 mainframe—deserves its modest place in computing lore. Running on vacuum tubes and ferrite core, the program searched only three plies (half-moves) ahead, evaluating about 2-3 positions per second and usually choosing the first move it considered marginally acceptable. Because the machine’s memory topped out at 12 000 words, positions were encoded to sip bits the way early automobiles rationed gasoline. Attack tables were pre-calculated and stored in fast core, but the evaluator was naïve: material dominated everything; king safety meant little; and long-term strategy was nonexistent. On a good day, with favorable parameters, the program trounced rank beginners; against strong club players it collapsed, often walking pieces into forks or ignoring developing moves that any human would spot in seconds. Still, what mattered was proof-of-concept: that symbolic reasoning and search could be separated, cached, and automated at all. The eight-foot-tall 704 hissed and clacked like an anxious typewriter, its row of indicator lights flickering in sync with each branch of the game tree. Contemporary critics dismissed the effort as parlor theater, yet the same core routines—minimax with alpha-beta’s embryonic shadow—would reappear in every serious engine from Belle to Deep Blue. Modern players will find the games quaint: castling is forgotten, perpetual-check loops are common, and blunders arrive on schedule every dozen moves. Viewed historically, though, the 1956 program is less a throwaway relic than a stethoscope pressed to the chest of a newborn discipline, confirming that a machine could at least limp through an opening without toppling its king. For that foundational curiosity alone—igniting decades of research into evaluation heuristics, move ordering, and ultimately brute-force supremacy—it earns a respectful nod. Play through the score today and you will laugh, but remember: every contemporary grandmaster killer began by stumbling through the same hazy three-move mist.\"", "cost": 0.0008945, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

I keep scrolling through old photos and laughing at the one where you tried to skateboard down that hill in the rain; my phone’s storage is basically a shrine to our questionable decisions. First off, tell me everything: how’s the new apartment treating you, did the upstairs neighbor ever stop rehearsing tap-dance routines at 3 a.m., and have you finally trained yourself to keep a houseplant alive for more than a month? I remember you swearing that the succulent you named “Bruce” was immortal, so I need closure on that saga. How’s the job hunt, or if you settled somewhere, are they at least stocking the break room with snacks that don’t taste like cardboard? And your sister—did she ever open that bakery she kept talking about, the one with the 47-step sourdough that required Gregorian chant and a full moon?\n\nOn my end, the universe has spun like a slot machine and somehow lined up three cherries. I’m still pinching myself every sunrise. Last week I caught myself staring at the espresso machine in my kitchen like it was an alien artifact; it has more buttons than the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon and it plays a tiny jazz riff when the shot is ready. I rehearsed the phrase “double ristretto” in the mirror until my reflection started judging me. The fridge is now so spacious that I installed a revolving lazy Susan for hot sauces; I spin it when I can’t decide between chipotle-mango and ghost-pepper-honey. I even bought a temperature-controlled drawer solely for chocolate, because apparently adulthood means pampering cacao.  \n\nRemember how we used to split a five-dollar pizza and call it fine dining? Last night I accidentally referred to the delivery driver as my “personal culinary courier” and tipped him in truffles; he looked at me like I’d offered him a live peacock. I’ve started receiving invitations to things called “soft openings” where the appetizers have names I can’t pronounce without a glossary. They hand you a glass of something crisp the color of liquid sunlight and nobody double-checks the bill when it arrives folded on a silver tray.  \n\nThe car situation upgraded itself, too. My new ride parallel-parks itself while humming Chopin; I just sit there pretending I’m still doing the work, foot hovering over a pedal that no longer needs me. It feels like having a chauffeur made of code and polished steel. On the highway, the heads-up display throws navigation lines onto the windshield like I’m inside a video game, and the seats give me a gentle squeeze when I’ve been driving too long, like a robotic mom telling me to stretch.  \n\nI’ve been traveling more than my mail carrier. One weekend I woke up in a cliff-side suite where the bathtub overlooked the ocean; the waves were so close I could taste salt in my shampoo. Another trip, the hotel left a folded swan on my pillow made from genuine silk; I felt bad unfolding it so I slept on the couch, which was probably twice the size of my old dorm room. The concierge asked if I wanted the helicopter or the yacht for tomorrow’s sightseeing; I picked the boat because seaspray seems more authentic than rotor-wash.  \n\nBack home, the closet situation escalated: it now has its own chandelier and a mirror that lights up like I’m about to accept an Oscar for Best Sweater Choice. Half the shirts still have tags because I keep forgetting I already “rewarded” myself for existing that particular Tuesday. My sneaker rack is a rotating column that hisses softly when I spin it—like footwear’s version of a revolving sushi bar, except every piece is limited edition and smells faintly of brand-new rubber.  \n\nWork is still work, but the stakes feel different. I can green-light passion projects without holding a bake sale for funding, so we’re shooting a documentary about urban beekeeping on rooftops nobody knew existed. The crew jokes that our budget line for “miscellaneous wonder” is bigger than the entire last film I made in your garage with that hand-me-down camcorder.  \n\nHealth-wise, I hired a trainer who quotes Marcus Aurelius between burpees; I’m basically paying to be conquered by a philosopher in yoga pants. My smartwatch congratulates me in Latin when I hit 10,000 steps—felt pretentious at first, but now I stride around the block until I get “Veni, vidi, vici” on my wrist like a digital laurel wreath.  \n\nI finally installed that home theater you and I used to sketch on napkins. The screen drops from the ceiling like a secret agent’s map and the低音炮 vibrates the sofa so my spine becomes a subwoofer. We should marathon the entire director’s-cut trilogy you love; I can even cue fake thunderstorm effects so the room smells like petrichor at the pivotal scene. Popcorn arrives via a little dumbwaiter from the kitchen, dressed in truffle oil and parmesan that snows down from a mini shaker spinning overhead.  \n\nSpeaking of parmesan, I enrolled in a cooking class taught by a guy who looks like he should be fronting a jazz quartet. He insists we caress the basil leaves before slicing them so they “feel appreciated.” I giggled through the first lecture, but the risotto turned out so silky it nearly brought a tear to my eye, so apparently emotional validation works on rice.  \n\nI’ve also started collecting first-edition books; nothing screams “I have arrived” like opening a nineteenth-century novel and getting a faint whiff of Victorian anxiety. The shelf is climate-controlled because apparently paper is as needy as a tropical orchid. You’d get a kick out of the Steinbeck with the handwritten margin note: “This character is a rascal—approve!”  \n\nMy new financial advisor speaks in such calm tones I assume he moonlights as a meditation app; he refers to expenditures as “allocating joy” and to market dips as “momentary frowns.” I nod solemnly while picturing a spreadsheet wearing a tiny smiley-face sticker.  \n\nRemember our plan to open a taco truck that only played 80s power ballads? I haven’t forgotten. I bought a vintage Airstream that’s getting retrofitted with a marble counter and a sound system that can blast “Don’t Stop Believin’” loud enough to rattle guacamole. We could park it on my new plot of land upstate—yeah, apparently I now have acreage with a creek that produces its own soundtrack of gentle babbling. There’s a firepit ringed with Adirondack chairs that arrive already weathered so you look like you’ve been contemplating nature for decades.  \n\nYou should come visit; the guest room has a skylight positioned so the moon lands on the pillow like a spotlight for your dreams. I stocked the bathroom with towels so fluffy they could double as cloud surrogates. We could sip something smoky in snifters while arguing about whether the new Batman could beat the old one in a chess match.  \n\nI donated a chunk of “joy allocation” to the local animal shelter and they named a litter of kittens after my favorite cheeses: Brie, Gouda, and Stilton. I might adopt Stilton; he already struts like he owns the lobby, which is basically my spirit animal in feline form.  \n\nThey say gratitude is the best accessory, so I walk around feeling like a walking chandelier of thank-yous, even though I still spill coffee on myself at least once a week—some stains are stubborn against destiny.  \n\nI keep thinking we should schedule a no-agenda weekend: just drive until the playlist ends, eat gas-station snacks graded strictly on artificial-color intensity, and debate whether aliens would prefer disco or dubstep as Earth's welcome anthem. I can book us into that coastal inn where every room has a record player and a view of fishing boats bobbing like metronomes for the sea’s heartbeat.  \n\nHow’s your guitar practice coming? I upgraded to a vintage Strat that purrs so sweetly I feel like I’m cheating on my old acoustic; it hangs on the wall like art that occasionally hums lullabies. We could jam; my living room acoustics are engineered to make even my clumsy bar chords sound Grammy-adjacent.  \n\nAnd your mom—please tell her the recipe for her lemon bars lives rent-free in my hippocampus; I tried baking them but they turned into abstract art, so I need remedial instruction from the source. I’ll trade you a box of single-origin cocoa nibs that taste like a rainforest gave you a handshake.  \n\nDo you still write those six-word stories on napkins? I keep a stack handy next to the wine dispenser (yes, that’s a thing, and yes, it drips like an IV of relaxation). We could do a duet: your words, my unearned confidence, and a corkscrew that costs more than our first semester textbooks combined.  \n\nLife feels like someone handed me the remote to a premium streaming service and said, “Skip intro whenever you want,” yet the previews themselves are worth the price. I laugh more, worry less, and tip baristas like they’re granting wishes instead of foam art.  \n\nBut for all the gadgets and glossy brochures, the best perk is being able to answer a friend’s “Could you...?” with “Consider it done” before they finish the sentence. So if you need anything—concert tickets, a loan of my noise-canceling headphones that turn jet engines into lullabies, or just a couch that smells faintly of sandalwood and hindsight—holler.  \n\nSeriously, ping me when you’re free; we’ll put the “world” in “world-class hangout.” I’ll send a car that smells like new hope and old leather, and we’ll chase the sunset until it turns into sunrise, reminiscing about the days when our biggest dilemma was whose turn it was to spring for stale nachos.  \n\nUntil then, keep me posted on every mundane miracle: the first tomato in your windowsill garden, the quirky coworker who speaks entirely in movie quotes, the moment you finally beat that video-game boss who’s been taunting you since college.  \n\nI miss the simplicity of our dollar-store adventures, but I’ve learned you can bottle that feeling and cork it with a better vintage; the laughter stays the same, only the backdrop gets an upgrade.  \n\nDrop a line, send a smoke signal, or courier-pigeon if you’re feeling retro. I’ll be here, probably figuring out which button makes the patio fireplace change colors, waiting to hear your voice crack through the stories like an old vinyl that still knows how to spin.  \n\nTake care of yourself, hug Bruce the succulent (or his memory), and remember the universe has a weird way of loading the dice in your favor when you least expect it—sometimes you just have to roll ’em while whistling off-key.  \n\nLoads of warmth and ridiculously soft towels awaiting your arrival,  \n\n[Your Name]", "cost": 0.0046714999999999994, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences", "keywords:forbidden_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 40}, {"forbidden_words": ["rich", "money"]}], "result": true}

{"id": 209, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a blog post about the best way to get a good night's sleep with at least 400 words.", "response": "The Science-Backed Bedtime Ritual That Finally Gave Me 8 Hours of Dream-Grade Sleep\n\nI used to wear my 3 a.m. glow like a badge of honor. Inbox zero at dawn? Check. Podcast backlog conquered? Double check. Then one morning I caught my reflection in the elevator mirror—puffy eyes, grayish skin, the posture of a question mark—and realized I had turned into the “before” photo in a mattress commercial. That was the day I stopped treating sleep like a luxury add-on and started treating it like the nightly board meeting my brain and body deserved. The transformation wasn’t instant, but the protocol I distilled from a year of self-experimentation now hands me eight uninterrupted hours on a silver platter 95 % of the time. Here’s the exact blueprint.\n\n1. Sunlight at 7 a.m., sunglasses off.  \nYour circadian clock is an old-fashioned watch that still needs winding by natural light. I walk my dog for ten minutes eastward every morning, no matter the weather. The 10 000-lux signal tells the suprachiasmatic nucleus—your internal Rolex—to start its countdown to bedtime 16 hours later. Studies from the University of Colorado show this single habit shifts melatonin onset up to 90 minutes earlier.\n\n2. Caffeine curfew, not cliché.  \nI genetics-tested myself and discovered I’m a slow caffeine metabolizer (CYP1A2 *1F allele, if you’re geeky). Any coffee after 11 a.m. nixes deep slow-wave sleep. Track your last cup for one week; if your Oura ring shows less than 15 % deep sleep, move the cutoff earlier until the metrics recover.\n\n3. The 3-2-1 formula: no food 3 h, no work 2 h, no screens 1 h before bed.  \nDigestion raises core body temperature; screens spike cortisol. Replace the last hour with a paperback and a 4-7-8 breathing loop (inhale 4 s, hold 7 s, exhale 8 s). Navy SEALs use this to drop heart rate below 60 bpm in two minutes.\n\n4. Bedroom becomes a bat cave.  \nI swapped bulbs for dim, amber 1 800-K LEDs and taped over every charger light. Temperature is set to 18 °C (65 °F), the thermal zone that maximizes REM sleep according to a 2020 meta-analysis. Blackout curtains plus a $20 bed-tent flap erased the 5 a.m. garbage-truck strobe that used to yank me out of dream sequence.\n\n5. The “inverted snore” pillow hack.  \nSide-sleeping can collapse shoulder joints and torque the neck. I slide one thin pillow under my ribcage and another between knees, keeping cervical spine neutral. No more 2 a.m. numb hands or partner elbow-jabs.\n\n6. Audio nygmia instead of doom-scrolling.  \nWhen thoughts sprint, I cue a 15-minute “sleep story” on the Calm app—non-fiction plots read in a monotone so boring it’s brilliant. The brain craves narrative closure; give it one that tapers off instead of cliff-hanging.\n\n7. Weekend anchor, not catch-up.  \nI keep the same wake-up time within 30 minutes seven days a week. “Social jet lag”—the yo-yo between weekday and weekend schedules—has been linked to a 20 % drop in insulin sensitivity, aka pre-diabetes in pajamas.\n\nThe payoff? After six weeks my Garmin watch recorded an average 1 h 42 min of deep sleep, up from 48 min. My resting heart rate fell 7 bpm, and the afternoon brain fog that used to feel like wet cement simply vanished.

From Paleolithic refuse heaps to space-age orbital kennels, dogs have been witnesses, workers, symbols, and—on occasion—quiet critics of human ambition.  By reading the archival impressions dogs left on ourGarbage middens, literature, law, art, and genomes, students will interrogate familiar historical episodes from a non-human, non-predatory gaze that nonetheless exposes the predatory logics of empire, capitalism, and scientism.  The syllabus therefore satisfies three university imperatives: decolonizing the canon, integrating animal-studies methodology, and sharpening critical reading skills through source types previously dismissed as “cute” rather than crucial.\n\nLearning Outcomes  \nBy the end of the semester students will be able to:  \n1. Deconstruct the anthropocentric grand narrative by repositioning dogs as co-actors instead of props.  \n2. Map how shifting regimes of co-species labor (hunting, herding, war, bio-medical research) reveal larger economic and predatory structures.  \n3. Critically evaluate primary “dog-texts”: veterinary manuals, kennel-club minutes, canine burial data, Soviet space-capsule telemetry, Instagram pet-influencer metrics.  \n4. Produce a research paper that advances an original argument about a historical moment “as told by dogs,” using at least one non-traditional source (chew-mark patterns, isotope tails of dog hair, etc.).  \n5. Reflect ethically on the boundary between historical empathy and appropriation when speaking for non-human subjects.\n\nCore Themes & Weekly Arc  \nWeek 1  Who Speaks for Whom?

A community-engaged component partners with the local shelter: students will transcribe adoption cards from 1920-today, creating an open-access dataset on how economic downturns correlate with canine abandonment.

No prerequisites except sophomore standing and curiosity.  AEO-complaint: all films will be closed-captioned; tactile skull replicas provided for kinesthetic learners.  A course fee of $45 covers consumables (synthetic pheromones for safe shelter visit, 3-D printing filament).\n\nBudget Request (3-year pilot)  \n• $12 000 archival licensing (Hull University’s Soviet space-dog telemetry; Kennel Club minutes 1880-1950)  \n• $ 4 500 community-engagement stipends for shelter staff time  \n• $ 3 000 dog-bone isotope analysis demonstration  \n• $ 2 500 field-trip transport & ranch honoraria  \nTotal $22 000, to be cost-shared 60 % Academic Affairs, 40 % endowed Madigan Canine Studies Fund.\n\nSustainability & Expansion  \nUpon successful completion of its pilot cycle the course will be submitted for WI (Writing Intensive) and G (Global) designations, followed by a graduate seminar “Advanced Zoohistory & the Post-Anthropocene.”  Plans include an edited volume, “Curatorial Caninisms,” co-authored with students under a Creative Commons license.\n\nAccountability Metrics  \n• 80 % of enrolled students will agree or strongly agree (end-of-term survey) that “studying history through dogs helped me recognize hidden power structures.”  \n• 50 % of final research papers will be presented at the annual Animal History conference within two years.  \n• At least one shelter dataset produced by the class will be cited in a peer-reviewed publication by 2028.\n\nConclusion  \n“The History of the World, as Told by Dogs” nips at the heels of traditional geopolitical narratives, exposing how even the most predatory human systems relied on—yet effaced—canine labor, loyalty, and bodies.

The sales pitch should be 500 words long, funny, engaging, and focus on the benefits of the new diaper without mentioning the price. It must also contain a title, wrapped in double angular brackets, i.e. <<title>>.", "response": "<<The “Mom-Approved, Baby Booty Cloud” Diaper Pitch>>\n\nHey, Super-Mom! Yes, you—the woman who can open a applesauce pouch with her teeth while steering a shopping cart with her hip and Facetiming Grandma. Let me ask the age-old question: after all the heroic stuff you do, does your tiny human still waddle around like a prizewinning sumo in a scratchy paper pretzel? Exactly. That’s why we kidnapped every rainbow, every marshmallow, and every “aaah” sound ever made at day spas, and we stuffed them into our brand-new SnugglePlume™ diaper. (Trademark pending. Sanity-saving definite.)\n\nPicture this: 3 a.m., moonlight streaking across the nursery. You shuffle in, half-awake, ready for the nightly ration of—let’s say—biological glitter. Instead of the usual Velcro trumpet solo and plastic crinkle that sounds like stepping on bubble wrap, you find… silence. Your baby’s tush is lounging inside a silky, breathable hammock that basically gives their butt cheeks a first-class ticket to Chillville. No red karate-chop marks. No sauna-induced meltdowns. Just happy cheeks. Cheeks so happy they could audition for a diaper commercial themselves.\n\n“But will it hold the Mississippi?” you ask. Sweet mercy, YES. Our engineers (a squad of ex-NASA scientists and one grandma named Linda who’s changed 14,000 diapers) invented the Double Helix Levee Gusset. Translation: the laws of physics bow to toddler pee. Side explosions? Not on our watch. The absorbent core can lock away more liquid than a toddler’s bedtime stalling tactics. Translation to translation: fewer outfit changes, fewer sofa casualties, fewer moments where you silently apologize to your furniture.\n\nRemember when you tried yoga and realized your leggings were see-through in downward dog? Our elastic isn’t that rude. We use MicroFlex-Spandex spun by angels—so gentle it basically recites lullabies while hugging those Michelin-man rolls. Babies can downward-dog, upward-moose, or kangaroo-kick their way through the day without leaving behind sock-band-style thigh imprints. Grandma will stop muttering, “That diaper looks tight, honey.” You’re welcome, family harmony.\n\nThe topper? A 3-second “Glam-Slide” tab system. Because when your kiddo’s doing the alligator death roll on the changing pad, every nanosecond counts. Rip, wrap, slap—boom. You’re done faster than dad can say, “I think I left the wipes in the car.” Bonus: the tabs realign, so when you inevitably realize the diaper is backwards (we’ve all been there), you can course-correct without inventing new profanity.\n\nHere’s my favorite part—the smell-eater lining. Translation: your nursery won’t smell like a cheese factory in a heatwave. The lining contains odor-neutralizing herbs: lavender so you’re calm, chamomile so baby’s zen, and a whisper of eucalyptus so you can pretend you live in a spa instead of a Duplocalypse. Guests walk in and ask, “Did you just bake cookies in here?” Nope, that’s just our aromatherapeutic tush technology, but thanks for the confidence boost.\n\nLet’s not forget style points. We ditched the boring beige and commissioned unicorn palettes: Cosmic Cobalt, Watermelon Wiggle, and Dozing Dinosaur (glows softly under night-lights so you can find the cute bum in the dark). Instagram doesn’t need another poo-sposion moment—it needs your baby’s belfie (butt-selfie) breaking the cute-o-meter.\n\nSo, Wonder Woman with the diaper bag, give your spawn the comfort their cheeks deserve, and give yourself calm, clean, comedy-free changes. Because happy cheeks make happy shrieks (the joyful kind, not the post-apocalyptic kind).\n\nSlide those little legs into a SnugglePlume™, toss the old crinkle-box into the Smithsonian of Regret, and watch your baby smile like they just got away with feeding the dog your grocery list. Comfortable babies nap longer. Longer naps mean hot coffee, maybe even a shower. And that, Mama, is the real sprinkle on the parenting cupcake.", "cost": 0.001836, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

THEODORE, THE GREEN-CLOAKED INNOCENT, REPRESENTS PURE HEART, HIS ROUNDNESS BOTH PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL, A LIVING EMBODIMENT OF THE FACT THAT THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE ARE BOTH CUTE AND SLIGHTLY HUNGRY.\n\nTHE EVOLUTION OF ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS FROM NOVELTY RECORD TO MULTIMEDIA EMPIRE MIRRORS THE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION ITSELF. THE ORIGINAL RECORDS REQUIRED TAPE MANIPULATION AND VARISPEED TECHNIQUES THAT WERE REVOLUTIONARY FOR THEIR TIME, CREATING THE SONIC EQUIVALENT OF A CHIPMUNK BLACK HOLE WHERE VOCAL FREQUENCIES WERE STRETCHED AND COMPRESSED UNTIL THEY ACHIEVED ESCAPE VELOCITY FROM NORMAL HUMAN SPEECH PATTERNS. AS DECADES PASSED, THE CHIPMUNKS ADAPTED TO EACH NEW MEDIUM LIKE DIGITAL CHAMELEONS, FROM CARTOON SHOWS IN THE 1980S WHERE THEY BATTLED POLLUTION AND DRUG ABUSE WHILE STILL FINDING TIME TO PERFORM CONCERTS, TO CGI FILMS WHERE THEIR FUR WAS RENDERED WITH SUCH METICULOUS DETAIL THAT AUDIENCES COULD ALMOST SMELL THE VIRTUAL NUTS.\n\nTHE CHIPMUNKS' RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR HUMAN COUNTERPART DAVE SEVILLE REPRESENTS THE ULTIMATE FANTASY OF INTERGENERATIONAL COLLABORATION, WHERE A SINGLE MAN CAN SERVE AS FATHER, MANAGER, AND LONG-SUFFERING STRAIGHT MAN TO THREE RODENTS WHO POSSESS BOTH THE VOCAL RANGE OF MARIAH CAREY AND THE EMOTIONAL MATURITY OF SUGAR-HIGH TODDLERS. DAVE'S PERPETUAL CRY OF \"ALVIN!\" HAS BECOME A SHORTHAND FOR EVERY PARENT WHO HAS EVER WATCHED THEIR CHILD DISAPPEAR INTO A PILE OF DESTRUCTION WHILE MAINTAINING AN EXPRESSION OF INNOCENCE SO COMPLETE IT COULD BE USED TO POWER SMALL CITIES.\n\nTHE MUSIC OF ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS DESERVES RECOGNITION AS PERHAPS THE MOST AMBITIOUS COVER PROJECT IN HUMAN HISTORY, WHEREIN EVERY POPULAR SONG FROM \"BAD ROMANCE\" TO \"UPTOWN FUNK\" IS SUBJECTED TO THE CHIPMUNK TREATMENT, TRANSFORMING LYRICS ABOUT LOVE AND PARTYING INTO THE SOUNDTRACK OF A RODENT NIGHTCLUB WHERE THE DRINKS ARE SERVED IN ACORN SHELLS AND THE DANCE FLOOR IS LINED WITH BARK CHIPS. THIS PHENOMENON RAISES PROFOUND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF ART ITSELF: IF A SONG CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED BY CHIPMUNKS, DOES IT NOT PROVE THAT THE UNIVERSALITY OF MUSIC TRANSCENDS SPECIES, PITCH, AND THE VERY CONCEPT OF DIGNITY?\n\nTHE CHIPMUNKS HAVE ALSO SERVED AS UNWITTING ARCHITECTS OF MODERN CELEBRITY CULTURE, THEIR STYLIZED HIJINX FORESHADOWING THE INFLUENCER ERA WHERE PERSONALITY IS CURRENCY AND CONTENT MUST BE CONSTANTLY GENERATED TO FEED THE INSATIABLE MAW OF PUBLIC ATTENTION. THEIR EARLY ADOPTION OF MERCHANDISE, FROM LUNCH BOXES TO UNDERWEAR, PREDATED THE MODERN TIE-IN ECONOMY BY DECADES, PROVING THAT EVEN CREATURES WHO THEORETICALLY SHOULD BE HIBERNATING SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR CAN MAINTAIN A YEAR-ROUND BRAND PRESENCE STRONG ENOUGH TO MOVE PLASTIC FIGURINES AND FLAME-RETARDANT PAJAMAS.\n\nIN CONTEMPLATING THE LEGACY OF ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS, WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ROLE AS UNLIKELY PHILOSOPHERS, TEACHING GENERATIONS THAT THE HIGHEST PITCHED VOICES OFTEN CARRY THE DEEPEST TRUTHS ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, PERSEVERANCE, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A GOOD SOUND SYSTEM. THEY HAVE SHOWN US THAT FAMILY IS NOT JUST ABOUT BLOOD, BUT ABOUT THE PEOPLE (OR CHIPMUNKS) WHO STAND BY YOU EVEN WHEN YOUR LATEST SCHEME HAS RESULTED IN THE DESTRUCTION OF A MAJOR APPLIANCE OR THE ACCIDENTAL RELEASE OF A ZOO ANIMAL.\n\nAS WE LOOK TOWARD THE FUTURE, WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MAY SOON ALLOW US TO CREATE PERFECT CHIPMUNK HARMONIES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR TAPE MANIPULATION OR HUMAN VOICES AT ALL, WE MUST ASK OURSELVES: WILL THE CHIPMUNKS CONTINUE TO ADAPT, PERHAPS AS VIRTUAL INFLUENCERS IN THE METAVERSE, THEIR FUR NOW COMPOSED OF PIXELS INSTEAD OF POLYGON RENDERINGS? OR WILL THEY REMAIN TIMELESS, A CONSTANT REMINDER THAT SOMETIMES THE MOST PROFOUND STATEMENTS COME NOT FROM THE DEEPEST BASS NOTES, BUT FROM THE HIGHEST, FASTEST, MOST IMPROBABLY CARTOONISH VOICES THAT SCIENCE AND ART CAN CONSPIRE TO CREATE?\n\nIN CONCLUSION, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS STAND NOT MERELY AS ENTERTAINMENT FIGURES, BUT AS CULTURAL TOUCHSTONES THAT HAVE BURROWED THEIR WAY INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS. THEY ARE THE SOUNDTRACK TO ROAD TRIPS, THE BACKDROP TO BIRTHDAY PARTIES, THE UNEXPECTED EARWORM THAT EMERGES FROM THE RADIO AT 2 AM LIKE A FURRY, HARMONIOUS VISITATION. THEY ARE PROOF THAT WITH ENOUGH CREATIVITY, TECHNOLOGY, AND PURE UNADULTERATED CHUTZPAH, THREE SMALL CREATURES WHO SHOULD THEORETICALLY BE INCAPABLE OF SPEECH CAN TEACH US ALL TO SING ALONG, EVEN IF THE WORDS COME OUT SO FAST THEY SOUND LIKE THEY'RE BEING DELIVERED BY A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC AUCTIONEER WHO HAS ALSO RECENTLY INHALED HELIUM.\n\nTHE CHIPMUNKS WILL NEVER BE LATE, BECAUSE THEY EXIST OUTSIDE OF TIME ENTIRELY, ETERNAL PRISONERS OF THEIR OWN MUSICAL ACCELERATION, TRAPPED IN A PERPETUAL NOW WHERE EVERY SONG IS SIMULTANEOUSLY A COVER AND AN ORIGINAL, WHERE EVERY \"ALVIN!\" IS BOTH A SCOLDING AND A LOVE SONG, WHERE EVERY ACORN IS BOTH A SNACK AND A METAPHOR FOR THE INFINITE POSSIBILITIES THAT AWAIT WHEN WE ALLOW OURSELVES TO IMAGINE THAT EVEN THE SMALLEST VOICES CAN FILL THE BIGGEST ROOMS.", "cost": 0.00388, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_capital"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}
{"id": 2250, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write exactly 4 paragraphs about tips for installing a car seat for moms. Use 2 new lines to separate paragraphs. Start the 4th paragraph with the word \"elm\".", "response": "Start by reading both the car-seat manual and the vehicle manual twice—once the night before and again while you stand at the open door with the seat in hand. Highlight the sections that explain lower-anchor weight limits, seat-belt lock-offs, and the exact recline angle for your baby’s age; snap a quick photo of those pages so you can zoom in instead of squinting while the baby squirms. Before you wrestle anything into place, move the front seat up, recline it, and flip the headrest out of the way so you gain maximum clearance; doing this first saves the lower-back ache that comes from crouching around poorly positioned furniture.\n\nWhen you thread the belt or latch strap, kneel in the seat with all your body weight—yes, 140 pounds of mom counts as an installation tool—so the base compresses into the cushion and the slack disappears before you tighten. Listen for two clicks: one from the latch connector or seat-belt latch plate, and a second, subtler click when the tension ratchet bites; if you don’t hear that second click, undo and start over instead of hoping it’ll settle later. After the install, grasp the belt path and shake with the same energy you use to test if a stroller brake is on—if the whole car shifts before the seat budges, you’ve nailed it; if the seat wiggles more than an inch, rotate the base 180° and try again because micro-adjustments rarely fix a macro problem.\n\nDress the baby in nothing thicker than a mid-weight cotton onesie on travel day; stash the puffy snowsuit in the diaper bag and slide it on after you arrive so the harness can hug the actual child, not a bubble of air that compresses in a crash. Position the chest clip at armpit level by picturing the top of a sports bra—if you wouldn’t clip a bra there, it’s too low—and pinch the strap at the collarbone; if the web folds like a taco, ratchet one more click even if you feel mean. Finally, drop your phone flashlight behind the shell to hunt for twists; a half-twist that looks harmless can shave 30% off the strap’s strength in a 30-mph test, and you deserve 100% of the protection you just wrestled into place.\n\n\nelm, once the seat is rock-solid, sign up for a free checkpoint event at the fire station or Children’s Hospital parking lot the way you’d schedule a pediatrician visit—put it on the calendar before you leave the hospital so it becomes part of the newborn haze, not an afterthought. Bring coffee, apologize in advance for the spit-up on your shoulder, and let the certified tech undo and redo every step while you film it on slow-motion so you can replay the angles later. The ten minutes of awkward hovering buys you years of confidence every time you click that same seat into grandma’s SUV or an airport rental, and that confidence is the quietest, strongest love you can strap around your baby on every single ride.", "cost": 0.0012885, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "elm", "num_paragraphs": 4, "nth_paragraph": 4}], "result": true}

Founded in the 1600s as English agricultural settlements, communities such as Southampton, East Hampton, and Sag Harbor evolved into resort destinations during the Gilded Age once rail lines reached [Sag Harbor train station] in the late 1800s. Today the name signals exclusivity: cedar-shingled mansions, pristine Atlantic beaches, centuries-old farm fields converted to vineyards and polo grounds, and the social cachet of (season) July-September “see-and-be-seen” life.

Despite the wealth, year-round residents retain a maritime culture, sharing clam-shucking rituals and fishing histories with seasonal visitors.\n\nRegistering a collective land area of ~140 square miles, the Hamptons alternate between conservation acreage and overbuilt shoreline. The Town of East Hampton includes 70 miles of beachfront protected under the Community Preservation Fund; meanwhile, the Town of Southampton remains the anchor of the U.S. luxury real estate market, recording single-home sales above $100 million.\n\n* Benefiting from both an Atlantic double-ocean effect and outwash plain geology, the region enjoys noticeably cooler sea breezes than inland long-island towns while supporting world-class vineyards like [Wölffer Estate] where chardonnay grapes thrive, creating a microclimate that wine traders compare to Bordeaux circa 1980s seasonability.\n\n* Cultural life extends beyond nightclubs into the arts: the annual Hamptons International Film Festival screens at East Hampton’s Guild Hall while the Parrish Art Museum in Water Mill maintains a [25,000-square-foot] Herzog & de Meuron building that curates exhibits of American Impressionists who first painted the local dunes over a century ago.\n\nVisitors can arrive via Montauk Highway (Route 27) or by the Long Island Rail Road from Penn Station to Montauk; another favored route involves a seaplane from Manhattan’s East 23rd Street Skyport landing at East Hampton Airport in under 45 minutes.

The response must contain at least 1 placeholders represented by square brackets, such as [address].", "response": "My Fellow Mothers of [address] and every cul-de-sac, kitchen, and car-pool line in between,\n\nI’m writing to you tonight not as the President, but as a dad who has paced a nursery floor at 3 a.m. while the rest of the house slept, and who knows that nothing rattles a parent’s heart faster than a child’s sudden silence. That silence is exactly what the red balloon from the movie *It* carries—only it isn’t floating across Derry, Maine; it drifts straight out of the 1950s and into our living rooms, asking us to remember what we promised we would never forget.\n\nWhen Stephen King hung that single crimson sphere above a storm drain, he wasn’t just warning kids to stay clear of clowns; he was tying a knot in the string of American memory. The balloon is the spirit of the fifties because it looks, at first glance, like innocent fun—bright, weightless, the perfect birthday party prop. But it is also buoyed by pressures we spent the decade pretending we didn’t see. Beneath its cheerful color is helium forced into a rubber skin, the same way post-war cheerfulness was stretched thin over anxieties too unsettling to name: polio, the Bomb, Sputnik’s beep overhead, and the first stirrings of a civil rights movement that would soon rattle every window in suburbia.\n\nYou and I teach our kids to be polite, finish their vegetables, and look both ways. The fifties taught much the same—manners, modernity, and forward motion—yet the balloon reminds us that politeness can also be a costume. Pennywise uses it to lure children with birthday songs and promises of popcorn, just as glossy magazine ads once lured families to fallout shelters disguised as fabulous “family rooms.” We wanted so badly to believe the decade was safe that we painted danger the same candy-apple red as a new Studebaker and called it progress.\n\nStill, mothers have always known how to read the air. We feel a storm before the weatherman announces it, just as we feel history tugging at the hem of our apron. The balloon rises only when someone lets go of the string. In the fifties, many parents unknowingly opened their fingers—trusting pills to quiet restless housewives, trusting television to babysit, trusting the government to test bombs far enough from our backyards. By the time the sixties arrived, that released balloon had become the bobbing marker of every issue we’d refused to confront: segregation, sexism, and the lie that comfort equals security.\n\nTonight, I want us to reclaim the balloon, not pop it. Tie it to something sturdier than fear. Tie it to the high-chair you wrestle into the car at dawn, to the homework you check while dinner simmers, to the conversations you squeeze in between loads of laundry about why kindness matters more than cruelty. In doing so we ground the spirit of the fifties not in denial, but in determination: determination that no decade’s shiny surface will ever again hide the cracks beneath; determination that our daughters and sons will grow up reading danger in any color, even red; determination that when a stranger offers them a balloon, they will remember our voices and walk away.\n\nLet the studios keep their remakes and reboots. We have the original story, the one we write daily in spilled juice, math-quiz tears, and good-night prayers. And every time we stand at our windows—watching our children pedal down the block, backpacks thumping like small, brave hearts—we are editing the national script. We are ensuring the next generation’s spirit is lighter than helium yet anchored to justice, empathy, and truth.\n\nSo if tomorrow morning you glimpse a lone red balloon caught in the neighbor’s oak, don’t simply sigh at the litter. See it as a flare from the past, asking each mom to keep her grip on the string of conscience. Pop it with your keys if you must, but better yet: bring it inside, deflate it slowly, and teach your kids why it rose in the first place. In that small, stubborn act of motherhood, we will have rescued the fifties from nostalgia and returned them to history, exactly where they belong.\n\nWith gratitude for every bedtime story, every packed lunch, and every kindness you model when you think no one is watching,\n\nYour fellow parent in the Oval Office", "cost": 0.0018735, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"num_placeholders": 1}], "result": true}

When the parchment was inked, a musket farted but once ere it must be primed anew; now but one dark engine may spit an hundred deaths ere a man draw breath. Thus men cry: “Surely a right framed for a rustic piece is ill-suited to engines that rival the canon’s roar!”  \n\nNext, the body politic is no more a scatter’d yeomanry, but a mighty commonweal of cities packed thick as bees in summer hives. Sheriffs, constables, and watchful constitutions of law stand ready, day and night, to guard each threshold. Wherefore, say the doubters, need each household keep an armory, when the state’s own sword is ever near at hand?  \n\nThird, our land is rent with weeping; for each moon that waneth, new widows howl, and orphans wander, made so by weapons loosed in heat of wrath. The blood of the innocent crieth aloud, and citizens grow pale, murmuring: “Better the musket be tamed than the people be slain.”  \n\nFourth, the ancient fear of tyrants—though it yet lurk in prudent hearts—groweth faint beside the fear of neighbourly slaughter. They argue: “What emperor dare assail a nation whose fleets ride the clouds and whose thunder lies in silos of iron? Our danger springs not from a distant throne but from our own hot blood.”  \n\nLastly, the world itself is alter’d; we traffic, study, and converse with nations that live ungirt by private arms, yet preserve their liberty by parchment, ballot, and cordial justice. From such examples doubters draw the moral: “Old charters must breathe the air of new ages, or they stifle those they once did shelter.”  \n\nThus, in sum, the Second Amendment is accounted a garment out-worn—too wide for our present shape, too frayed for our present peril—calling many voices to the cry: “Renew, reform, or rend it asunder!”", "cost": 0.001157, "instruction_id_list": ["combination:repeat_prompt"], "kwargs": [{"prompt_to_repeat": "Wherefore doth people consider the 2nd Amendment to be outdated?

Hardware accounts for forty percent. Local personnel accounts for thirty five percent. Cloud credits and travel cover the remainder.\n\nSuccess Metrics  \nLearners in pilot schools will gain an extra zero point seven standard deviations in literacy compared to matched controls. Teacher retention will rise by fifteen percent. Cost per learning gain will fall below one dollar.\n\nRisks and Mitigations  \nDevice theft will be addressed through community ownership plans and engraved serial numbers. Power outages will be offset by solar chargers. Model bias will be tracked through weekly fairness dashboards. Political shifts will be met by open licensing that allows any future government to continue without us.\n\nConclusion  \nThis project treats every child as a data point who can train the next generation of learners. By keeping code open data private and hardware cheap we can close the global learning gap within a decade.", "cost": 0.0013585, "instruction_id_list": ["punctuation:no_comma"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

After eight years of mobilizing voters through campus coalitions, union halls, and neighborhood associations, I am eager to channel that experience into large-scale, energizing events that convert first-time attendees into lifelong volunteers—and, most importantly, into reliable voters on Election Day.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Proven Ability to Turn Enthusiasm into Turnout**\nIn 2022 I coordinated the “March to the Polls” initiative that transported 3,400 infrequent voters from 27 precincts to early-vote sites across **South [County]**. By pairing ride-share codes with live music pop-ups outside grocery stores, we achieved a **38% increase** in early-ballot submissions among voters aged 18–34 compared to the previous mid-term. Our secret sauce was data: we A/B-tested reminder scripts, color-coded wave schedules, and tracked RSVPs in real time. I will import that same metrics-driven approach to every rally we stage—no guesswork, only growth.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Coalition-Building Across Traditional Divides**\nLast spring I co-chaired the **“Parents & Patrons for Public Schools”** forum that brought together teachers’-union stewards, small-business owners, and faith leaders to oppose budget cuts. Despite divergent ideologies, we secured 1,100 petition signatures in 72 hours and compelled the county commission to restore $2.3 million in classroom funding. As your Rally Organizer, I will replicate this model: staging pre-race “listening lunches” with veterans, nurses, and agricultural co-ops so that every podium speaker reflects the district’s full spectrum—making our rallies feel like *home* to voters who have never seen themselves in partisan politics.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Safety, Accessibility, and Buzz—Engineered in Advance**\nFrom micro-rallies at rural high-school football games to a 2,000-person waterfront convention, I have managed events compliant with ADA, OSHA, and Secret Service protocols. My **90-day Rally Playbook** includes:  \n- **Dual-stage design** (main + ASL-visible overflow)  \n- **Color-coded credentialing** that cuts check-in time to <90 seconds  \n- **Digital “Rally after the Rally”**—QR codes that push personalized absentee-ballot links before attendees reach their cars  \nThese details don’t just prevent headaches; they generate earned media. Our 2023 Labor Day picnic trended #1 on local Twitter for six hours and was later featured in *The [City] Tribune*’s Sunday front page—free publicity worth an estimated $18k.\n\n---\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to present a **2025 Rally Calendar**—complete with proposed venues, speaker rosters, and budget benchmarks—at your next executive-board meeting. Thank you for your dedication to expanding the electorate and for considering my application. Together we can transform rallies into precinct-level power that endures long after the last balloon drops.\n\n**With energy and optimism,**\n\n[Your Signature (for hard copy)]  \n[Your Name]", "cost": 0.001519, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"num_highlights": 3}], "result": true}

Spring was drafted first,  \nforced to charge across no-man’s-land  \nwearing only its coat of poppies.  \nSummer went next, leaving the orchards  \nhalf ripe, apples stopped in midsentence.  \nAutumn deserted; Winter stayed to command  \nthe occupation of the calendar.  \nOne learns to live inside a pause so long  \nit feels like permanence. Children  \nwere born, grew beards, died,  \nall under the same stalled skyflash.  \nLove affairs began with the caveat  \nthat every kiss might be requisitioned  \nas evidence against the lover.  \nEven the clocks went underground,  \nticking in bunkers where time  \nwas measured by the growth of stalactites  \non the barrels of guns.  \nWe spoke of peace the way prisoners  \nspeak of sunrise—ritualistically,  \nwithout expectant eyes.  \nThe word itself became a kind of shrapnel,  \nlodged in the throat, carried  \nthrough every subsequent conversation,  \na metallic taste you could neither cough out  \nnor swallow.  \nAnd yet—  \nbetween bombardments, something still grew:  \na vine of small, illicit mercies.  \nA soldier shared his last water  \nwith the horse that had carried him  \nto the place where he would die.  \nA widow planted potatoes  \nin the shadow of the observation balloon,  \nand the potatoes, incredulous, grew.  \nA radio operator caught,  \nin the static between death and death,  \na lullaby his mother had sung;  \nhe sang it backward into the ether,  \nand on the far side of the frontline  \na child too young to know the words  \nhummed the tune exactly wrong,  \nwhich made it right.  \nThese moments did not end the war—  \nnothing ended the war—  \nbut they braided a rope  \nthat kept the war from completely unmaking  \nthe idea of morning.  \nSo when, at last, the silence came,  \nit was not victory, only exhaustion  \nfolded into a truce the way  \nan old soldier folds his flag:  \nwith trembling hands,  \nwithout ceremony,  \nrefusing to meet his own eyes  \nin the triangle of sky  \nwhere once the colors flew.  \nAnd the towns rebuilt themselves  \nin the image of amnesia;  \ncafés opened where arsenals had been,  \nlovers strolled across bridges  \nthat still carried, in their rivets,  \nthe fingerprints of the dead.  \nWe taught the new children  \nto pronounce the word “peace”  \nas if it were a foreign country  \nthey might one day visit,  \nnever mentioning  \nthat its passport is stamped  \nwith the ink of our own continuing  \ncivil war against the past.  \nBecause the war does not end;  \nit only goes indoors,  \ntakes off its boots,  \nleans its rifle in the corner  \nlike a grandfather’s cane,  \nand stares at us  \nfrom every mirror we dare to face.  \nWe grow old polishing its medals,  \nwearing its scars  \nas if they were our own skin,  \nwhich, in a way, they are.  \nAnd still, somewhere,  \na young man who believes  \nhe has never heard a shot fired  \nfeels the sudden draft  \nof an open door inside his chest,  \nand steps through—  \ncarrying the war forward  \nthe way a tongue carries  \nthe taste of iron  \nit cannot name  \nbut will,  \nin time,  \npass on.\n\nP.P.S.  \nIf you ever find, tucked inside a secondhand book,  \na pressed violet and a note in a stranger’s hand—“I survived  \nbecause the sky was too astonished to fall”—  \nburn the violet, keep the ash in a matchbox,  \nand whenever the news begins to sound like trumpets,  \nopen the box quietly, blow the ash back into the air.  \nIt will not stop the next war, but for the length of one held breath  \nthe room will smell like late spring, 1918,  \nand someone, somewhere, may decide  \nto put the rifle down,  \njust for today.", "cost": 0.0021655, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_content:postscript"], "kwargs": [{"postscript_marker": "P.P.S"}], "result": true}

Drawing upon archival materials from [library archive], biometric data released by [medical center], and 47 semi-structured interviews conducted with former senior staff at [venue], the study constructs a triangulated portrait of executive load. Findings suggest that situational entropy, informational density, and role conflict converge to create a unique operational climate that can elevate cardiovascular indicators, compress decision-making windows, and recalibrate circadian patterns. The inquiry concludes with a set of evidence-based recommendations directed toward [government agency], [white house office], and future transition teams to institutionalize recuperative protocols without compromising constitutional obligations.\n\nIntroduction  \nFrom the moment the President-elect arrives at [address] on Inauguration Day, a calibrated matrix of expectations, protocols, and symbolic burdens begins to unfold. While the literature has long celebrated the rhetorical brilliance and institutional power inherent in the office (Neustadt, 1990; Kernell, 2018), fewer empirical studies have centered on the interior experience of the officeholder situated within [oval office] and [residence]. This investigation therefore asks: How does the most visible political figure in the United States navigate the relentless cadence of executive life, and what cascading effects emerge across cognitive, somatic, and administrative domains?\n\nLiterature Review  \nScholarship on executive ergonomics has traditionally focused on scheduling optimization (Lewis, 2019) or crisis decision archetypes (George, 2021). Missing is a granular account of how micro-temporal demands—such as the 2:47 a.m. secure fax received at [situation room]—aggregate into macro-level patterns. Medical investigations conducted aboard [aircraft] and at [camp] reveal elevated nocturnal cortisol slopes relative to age-matched controls (Benson et al., 2020). Yet these datasets remain compartmentalized, necessitating an integrative framework that bridges political science, physiology, and organizational behavior.\n\nMethodology  \nA sequential explanatory design was adopted. Phase One extracted metadata from [digital archive] spanning [year range], isolating 1,832 daily schedules, each annotated to the minute. Phase Two employed wearable technology provided by [tech company] to record heart-rate variability (HRV) and galvanic response for six former presidents during staged policy simulations at [retreat]. Phase Three convened focus groups with physicians, military aides, and communication directors at [conference center], yielding 1,214 pages of transcribed reflections. All protocols received IRB approval under protocol #[irb code].\n\nResults  \n1. Scheduling Compression: The average contiguous unbroken interval available for reflective thought was 10.4 minutes, occurring most often at [time].  \n2. Physiological Markers: HRV dipped below clinically validated thresholds on 68 % of days when more than [number] legislative priorities were contested concurrently.  \n3. Cognitive Load: Lexical analysis of extemporaneous remarks delivered at [podium] revealed a 22 % increase in abstract noun density, correlating with sustained overnight travel across [time zone] differentials.  \n4. Social Buffering: Presence of a trusted companion—oftenuxorial or filial—moderated cardiovascular reactivity by 14 % across events held in [garden] and [hall].  \n5. Institutional Scaffolding: Advance teams who embedded 7-minute micro-breaks at [interval] achieved 31 % faster consensus on [policy type] briefings.\n\nDiscussion  \nThe data triad confirms that presidential life is not merely demanding; its architecture is chrononormatively asymmetrical, compressing recuperation while elongating exposure. Whereas corporate executives can delegate granular oversight, the Commander-in-Chief retains statutory sole-authority functions (e.g., [executive order]) rendering conventional resilience models incomplete. The absence of a “step away” equivalent within the nuclear football protocol intensifies neuroendocrine activation, corroborating prior flight-deck studies (Adams, 2017). Yet, countervailing forces—ritualized camaraderie in [dining room], physical activity circuits at [gym], and pastoral counsel offered at [chapel]—function as covert regulatory inputs.\n\nRecommendations  \n1. Establish a non-partisan [position title] tasked with real-time biometric dashboards, mirroring NASA’s mission-control ethos.  \n2. Codify a constitutional “pause clause” allowing for a [number]-hour window of deliberative immunity during trans-global crises.  \n3. Expand [health unit] staffing to include sleep-cognition specialists who can redesign rally itineraries in harmony with circadian optimization software developed at [lab].  \n4. Institute bipartisan legislative retreats at [location] modeled on the Danish “folkemøde,” reducing identity-protective cognition that spikes amygdala reactivity.  \n5. Allocate discretionary funds within [budget line] for artistic or mindfulness engagements proven to restore default-mode network connectivity.\n\nConclusion  \nThe presidency’s temporal signature is a variable geometry of intensity, not a static emblem of authority. By synthesizing archival rhythm analysis, physiological telemetry, and elite interview testimony, this study illuminates how an office conceived in the 18th-century pace of quills and horseback now interfaces with microsecond data streams and 24-hour news ecologies. Future researchers should extend the dataset to [international counterpart] offices, testing whether cultural context moderates physiological outcomes. Until then, embedding recuperative micro-structures within the constitutional lattice is both a prudential imperative and a homage to the human vessel who occupies the resolute desk.\n\nAcknowledgments  \nGratitude is extended to [foundation] for grant support, to [librarian] for archival guidance, and to [interviewee] for candid recollections that humanized the quantitative arc of this inquiry.", "cost": 0.002607, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:forbidden_words", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{"forbidden_words": ["sad", "crazy", "stress"]}, {"num_placeholders": 15}], "result": true}

Figured I’d lay it out so you know it’s not you, it’s just… me being a walking bundle of tripwires.\n\nFirst, the big one: being interrupted mid-sentence. I know I talk fast when I’m excited, but when someone cuts in, my brain short-circuits and suddenly I’m eight years old again, being told my feelings are “too much.” I go quiet, then spend the next hour replaying the conversation, convinced I was annoying. Ridiculous, right?\n\nSecond, the “just relax” command. Holy hell. If I’m spiraling and you tell me to “just breathe,” my nervous system hears, “You’re failing at being calm.” Cue instant shame tsunami. Bonus trigger: being told I’m “too sensitive” while I’m actively trying not to cry. It’s like handing a drowning person a textbook on swimming.\n\nThird, group chats that erupt into side convos I’m not part of. Those little “@person” pings I don’t get? They feel like digital exclusion notes. My brain screams, “They’re all laughing without you,” even though I know it’s irrational. I mute the chat, then stress that I’ve missed something important. Vicious circle.\n\nOh, and canceling plans last-minute when I’ve already armor-plated myself for social interaction. I’ll spend hours psyching up, recharging alone, crafting the perfect energy reserves—then poof, canceled. The relief warps into resentment, then guilt for feeling resentful. It’s like prepping for a marathon that ends at the starting line.\n\nWeirdly, the tiniest thing—like someone borrowing my pen and not returning it—can snowball. My brain files it under “proof people don’t see me.” Stupid, but there it is.\n\nI’m working on it. Therapy, breathing exercises, the whole toolbox. Mostly I just need a second to name the feeling out loud: “I’m triggered, but it’s old stuff, not current you.” If I ever go radio-silent or get twitchy, feel free to ask, “Is this the eight-year-old or the now-you?” That code phrase helps me snap back.\n\nThanks for listening.

Grab some treats, your biggest smile, and let’s start a training adventure that ends in a tail-wagging finale you’ll never forget!\n\n1. Meet Your Teammate  \nBefore you teach anything, learn your dog’s “happy signals”: a loose tail, soft eyes, and tongue hanging out like a party banner. When you see those signs, your dog is ready to learn. If you see yawns, lip-licks, or a tucked tail, take a break—less stress means more success!\n\n2. Pick Your Magic Word  \nChoose one tiny word for each trick. “Sit” means only “Sit,” not “Sit down now please.” One word = less confusion for your pup. Say it like you’re casting a spell from your favorite storybook.\n\n3. Treat Toss Game  \na. Put a treat to your dog’s nose.  \nb. Lift the treat slowly over the head.  \nc. When the bottom hits the floor—ta-da!—say “Yes!” and share the snack.  \nFive minutes of this game beats a long, boring hour. Short and sweet keeps the fun meter high.\n\n4. Happy Dance Rewards  \nEvery time your dog gets it right, throw a 3-second party: tiny treat, gentle pat, and a cheer, “We’re heading to the finale!” Keep rewards small so your dog stays hungry for the next round.\n\n5. Kid-Sized Schedule  \nDogs love routines they can read like comic books. Try two mini sessions a day—one before school, one after homework. Stick the chart on the fridge; kids check the box, dogs learn faster, parents smile more.\n\n6. Oops-A-Daisy Moments  \nIf your pup jumps or barks, freeze like a statue. No shouting, no chasing—less excitement takes the air out of naughty balloons. After three frozen seconds, ask for a simple “Sit” and celebrate when it happens.\n\n7. The Big Finale  \nAt the end of the week, invite your family to a living-room talent show. Show off “Sit,” “Down,” “Spin,” and the brand-new “High-five.” Finish with a shower of cheese-cube confetti and a group hug. That’s your finale—everyone claps, tails whip back and forth, and you’re the superstar trainer!\n\nQuick Kid Trainer Checklist  \n☐ Treat pouch filled with pea-size goodies  \n☐ Happy voice ready (squeak like a cartoon character)  \n☐ Patience cape tied on—learning takes less time when you’re calm  \n☐ Camera nearby to record the finale for Grandma  \n\nRemember: you and your dog speak different languages, but kindness is universal.

{"id": 2637, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write a casual summary of the U.S. maternity leave policy with two sections (Section 1 and Section 2) and at least 25 sentences.", "response": "Section 1 – The legal baseline, in plain English  \n1. First things first: the United States does not guarantee paid maternity leave to anyone, at any income level, in any state.  \n2. What it does guarantee is 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave, but only if you work for a company with 50+ employees and only if you’ve clocked at least 1,250 hours in the past year.  \n3. That unpaid leave comes from a 1993 federal law called the Family and Medical Leave Act—FMLA for short—which also covers sick spouses, new dads, and military caregivers, so maternity is just one slice of the pie.  \n4. If your company has 49 employees, FMLA doesn’t apply, and your boss can legally hand you a pink slip while you’re still in the delivery room.  \n5. Likewise, if you’ve been on the job for 11 months and 29 days, you’re out of luck—1,250 hours is about 24 hours a week for 52 weeks, so part-time baristas and retail folks often miss the cutoff.  \n6. Teachers sometimes get trickier math: summer break weeks may not count toward “hours worked,” so a pregnant teacher might discover she’s not eligible after all.  \n7. The 12 weeks are unpaid, but your health insurance must stay in place; you just have to keep paying your normal premium, which can feel like a second rent bill when the paychecks stop.  \n8. FMLA also applies to adoption, so if you adopt a newborn you get the same 12 unpaid weeks as a birth mom—fair, but still zero cash.  \n9. Dads are technically eligible for the same 12 unpaid weeks, yet only about 20 % of men who qualify ever take it, mostly because they can’t afford the zero-income stretch.  \n10. If you’re a federal employee, you finally got paid leave in October 2020—12 weeks at full salary—making taxpayers the closest thing the U.S. has to a generous boss.  \n11. Military families get a quirky bonus: if the service member is deployed, the stay-at-home spouse can snag 12 extra weeks under something called “qualifying exigency,” but again, unpaid.  \n12. Gig workers, freelancers, Uber drivers, and anyone getting a 1099 instead of a W-2 are completely invisible in federal law; they’re off the map, no 12 weeks, no job protection, nothing.  \n13. Bottom line: FMLA is less a safety net and more a sieve—about 56 % of new moms don’t qualify for even the unpaid version.  \n\nSection 2 – The wild patchwork of real life, hacks, and small wins  \n14. Because the federal floor is so low, states started inventing their own rules, and now you need a color-coded map to keep track.  \n15. California was the first to flip the script in 2004: six weeks of partial pay (55 % of your salary, capped at a number that feels like 1998 rent) funded by a tiny payroll tax everyone pays.  \n16. New York followed, offering up to 12 weeks at 67 % pay, but you have to wade through an outdated website that crashes at 2 a.m. when you’re also pumping every three hours.  \n17. Washington State decided 67 % wasn’t cool and now pays 90 % for low-wage workers, sliding down to 73 % for six-figure tech folks—still beats zero.  \n18. Meanwhile, Texas and Florida remain firm “LOL, good luck” states, proudly offering nothing beyond the federal unpaid minimum.  \n19. Some cities got tired of waiting: San Francisco, Boston, and Washington, D.C. tack on extra weeks or higher wage-replacement rates, so your ZIP code can literally be worth thousands of diapers.  \n20. Large corporations smelled the PR gold and started one-upping each other; Netflix dangled 52 paid weeks, Google offers 24, and even Walmart—yes, Walmart—gave hourly workers 16 paid weeks in 2023.  \n21. Yet only 23 % of private-sector workers nationwide work for a company that hands out any paid parental leave, so most new moms still stitch together vacation days, sick days, and short-term disability that covers only six to eight weeks for a vaginal birth.  \n22. Short-term disability is the sneaky hack many women learn about from Reddit threads: it pays about 60 % of salary for “medical recovery,” but it’s taxable, ends abruptly, and labels you “disabled” for having a baby.  \n23. Coworkers sometimes donate PTO hours like it’s a GoFundMe, and HR will email the entire floor asking for “generous colleagues,” which is both heartwarming and dystopian.  \n24. Immigrant moms often fly home to Mexico, India, or Poland for half a year because grandparents plus paid foreign leave plus free babysitting beats anything the U.S. offers.  \n25. Black and Hispanic moms feel the gap the hardest: they’re overrepresented in low-wage jobs without paid leave, leading to higher rates of postpartum depression and three-month-old babies in day-care centers.  \n26. Breastfeeding rates dip when moms return to work at six weeks because pumping in a supply closet between shifts is a special kind of Olympic sport nobody trains for.  \n27. Economists keep yelling that every $1 spent on paid leave returns $1.20–$3.00 in reduced turnover and health costs, but Congress files that under “sounds socialist, pass.”  \n28. The latest federal proposal, the FAMILY Act, keeps dying in committee; it would give 12 weeks at two-thirds pay nationwide, funded like Social Security, but it’s been reintroduced so many times it’s basically legislative wallpaper.  \n29. So for now, having a baby in America feels like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel where half the pages are missing: some people get a year off with full pay, some go back to work still bleeding, and most just hope their manager likes babies enough to “figure something out.”", "cost": 0.002604, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 2}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 25}], "result": true}

Additionally, make sure to wrap your entire response with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"Adão e Eva foram os primeiros seres humanos criados por Deus, segundo o relato bíblico do livro de Gênesis. Deus formou Adão do pó da terra e soprou-lhe nas narinas o fôlego de vida, tornando-o um ser vivo. Colocou-o então no Jardim do Éden, um paraíso de delícias, onde havia toda sorte de árvores agradáveis à vista e boas para alimento. Surgiu, porém, a constatação de que Adão estava só; precisava de uma companheira. Por isso, Deus fez cair um sono profundo sobre Adão, tomou-lhe uma costela e, com ela, formou Eva. Quando Adão despertou e viu Eva, exclamou: «Esta, sim, é osso dos meus ossos e carne da minha carne!»\n\nNo meio do jardim havia duas árvores especialmente significativas: a árvore da vida e a árvore do conhecimento do bem e do mal. Deus permitiu que comesssem de todas as árvores, exceto da árvore do conhecimento do bem e do mal; nesse dia em que dela comessem, certamente morreriam. A serpente, considerada mais astuta que todos os animais do campo, indagou Eva sobre o comando divino. Eva respondeu que não podiam tocar na árvore, nem comer dela, sob pena de morte. A serpente, então, desmentiu Deus, dizendo: «Certamente não morrereis!» e acrescentou que Deus sabia que, quando comessem, os olhos de ambos se abririam e seriam como Deus, conhecendo o bem e o mal.\n\nEva viu que a árvore era boa para alimento, agradável aos olhos e desejável para dar entendimento; tomou do seu fruto, comeu e deu também ao marido, que estava com ela. Naquele instante, os olhos de ambos se abriram; perceberam que estavam nus, coseram folhas de figueira e fizeram para si aventais. Quando ouviram a voz de Deus passeando no jardim à hora da brisa, esconderam-se entre as árvores.\n\nDeus chamou Adão, perguntando onde estava. Adão respondeu que, ao ouvir a voz no jardim, temeu porque estava nu e se escondeu. Deus indagou quem lhe havia dito que estava nu; teria comido da árvore de que lhe ordenara que não comesse? Adão culpou Eva, que por sua vez culpou a serpente. Então, Deus amaldiçoou a serpente, prometendo que rastejaria sobre o ventre e comeria pó todos os dias de sua vida. Disse ainda haver inimizade entre ela e a mulher, entre sua descendência e o descendente dela, que lhe esmagaria a cabeça e ela lhe feriria o calcanhar.\n\nEm seguida, Deus disse à mulher que multiplicaria sua dor na concepção e que, com dor, daria à luz filhos; o desejo dela seria para o marido, que a dominará. A Adão disse que, por haver escutado a voz da mulher e comido da árvore, a terra seria amaldiçoada; comerias dela com fadiga, ela produziria espinheiros e cardos, e tu comerás erva do campo; com o suor do teu rosto comerás teu pão, até que tornes à terra, pois de pó és e ao pó tornarás.\n\nPor fim, Deus fez túnicas de peles para Adão e sua mulher, e os vestiu. Declarou, então, que o homem havia se tornado como um de nós, conhecendo o bem e o mal, não estendesse a mão e tomasse também da árvore da vida, e vivesse eternamente. Expulsou-os, pois, do Jardim do Éden, colocando querubins e uma espada inflamada que girava para guardar o caminho da árvore da vida.\n\nA narrativa de Adão e Eva reflete temas fundamentais: a criação, a liberdade, a desobediência, a culpa, o julgamento e a esperança. A desobediência trouxe dor e morte, mas também abriu caminho para a redenção futura, na promessa de que o descendente da mulher esmagaria a cabeça da serpente. A história permanece viva na memória cultural, recordando que toda escolha tem consequência e que a graça divina sempre oferece um novo começo.\"", "cost": 0.0024094999999999997, "instruction_id_list": ["language:response_language", "startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{"language": "pt"}, {}], "result": true}

 \nrq2: did the wars permanently shift liberia’s export basket from high-value minerals toward low-value commodities?  \nrq3: how do households with direct war exposure (displacement, asset loss, combat participation) differ in income, consumption, and credit access in 2024?  \nrq4: does geographic proximity to former conflict hotspots predict present-day poverty incidence after controlling for pre-war characteristics?  \nrq5: to what extent did debt relief and the 2007 liberia timber law reform revive forestry revenues?\n\n4. methodology\nmacro approach: synthetic control method using liberia and a weighted combination of 15 non-war west african economies (1980-2023).  \nmicro approach: three-wave household panel survey (n = 2,400) stratified by counties and former frontline status; difference-in-differences estimation.  \nsectoral approach: event-study regressions on quarterly export data disaggregated by commodity (liberian customs records 1985-2023).  \ndata sources: liberian institute of statistics & geo-information services (lisgis), central bank of liberia, international rubber study group, liberian extractive industries transparency initiative (leiti), and satellite night-light imagery as a proxy for local economic activity.  \nrobustness: placebo war tests, alternative donor pools, inverse probability weighting to correct for attrition in the household panel.\n\n5. expected results\npreliminary scoping suggests a 25–30 percent gdp loss persisting until 2010 and a permanent 15 percent gap relative to the synthetic control. iron ore output remains 60 percent below pre-war peak despite new concessions; rubber smallholders with war-induced tree loss earn 18 percent less than non-affected peers. we anticipate heterogeneous county effects: maryland and grand gedeh show slower convergence, while montserrado benefits from agglomeration around monrovia.\n\n6. policy relevance\nfindings will feed directly into liberia’s upcoming arpil (aid-for-policy-reform and investment loan) negotiations with the world bank and inform the liberian agricultural transformation agenda (lanta) 2025-30. by isolating effective recovery levers, the study can reduce reliance on external budget support and orient domestic resource mobilization toward high-return sectors.\n\n7. project timeline\nyear 1: data acquisition, cleaning, ethical clearance, baseline survey.  \nyear 2: econometric analysis, draft sectoral papers, stakeholder workshops in monrovia.  \nyear 3: final report, policy briefs, dataset publication on harvard dataverse, dissemination at [placeholder conference].\n\n8. budget (usd)\npersonnel (pi, 2 post-docs, 4 research assistants)        210,000  \nfieldwork & survey logistics                              85,000  \ndata licensing & satellite imagery                       22,000  \nworkshops & policy outreach                               18,000  \ncontingency (5%)                                         16,750  \ntotal                                                  351,750\n\n9. ethics\nthe project has received provisional approval from the university of [placeholder] institutional review board. informed consent, anonymity, and trauma-informed protocols will govern all respondent interactions; enumerators will be trained in collaboration with the liberia mental health association.\n\n10. outputs\nthree peer-reviewed articles (world development, journal of development economics, economic development & cultural change), one open-access dataset, four county-level policy briefs, an interactive web dashboard hosted at [placeholder url], and a phd dissertation chapter for the lead graduate assistant.\n\n11. sustainability\nlocal capacity building is embedded: two liberian master’s students will be sponsored to co-author papers; all code (r & stata) will be uploaded to github under mit license; and a memorandum of understanding with lisgis ensures updating of key indicators post-project.\n\n12. request\nwe seek funding of usd 351,750 over 36 months to execute the above plan and welcome collaborations with liberian ministries, international ngos, and the private sector.", "cost": 0.0022555, "instruction_id_list": ["change_case:english_lowercase", "detectable_content:number_placeholders"], "kwargs": [{}, {"num_placeholders": 1}], "result": true}

Imagine that you are giving a lecture to students at a school or university. Use markdown to highlight at least 3 sections of your answer (like this: *highlighted section*). Your answer must also contain at least one placeholder (an example of a placeholder is [address]).", "response": "# Shinto Shrines: What’s Inside?\n\nHello, everyone! Today we’re going to step through the torii gate—both literally and symbolically—into the world of a Shinto shrine. We’ll focus on *what is actually inside* the shrine precincts, why each item matters, and how the space is used by priests, parishioners, and the kami (Shintō deities) themselves. Feel free to jot questions on the provided cards; I’ll collect them at [address].\n\n---\n\n## 1. First Impressions: The Approach\n\nAs you walk the gravel path, notice three things that frame the experience long before you reach any building:\n\n1. **Purification Basin** – A small tank of running water with wooden ladles. Visitors rinse left hand, right hand, then mouth. This is *self-purification*—a physical act to prepare the spirit.\n2. **Torii Gate** – Painted orange-red at many sites, it marks the conceptual boundary between the mundane and the sacred. Pass through it mindfully; bowing is customary but optional.\n3. **Komainu (Guardian Lion-Dogs)** – One mouth open (first guardian), one closed (last guardian). They deter malevolent forces; photograph them if you like, but don’t climb.\n\nEven though these elements are outdoors, they are part of the shrine’s sacred geography and set the tone for everything *within* the complex.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Heart of the Compound: *Honden*\n\nStrictly speaking, only priests may enter the **Honden** (Main Hall). Students often ask, “Can we peek?” The answer is: the building is designed so you *can’t* see directly inside, because its interior is the most sanctified zone. Here’s what is actually there:\n\n- **Shintai** – A sacred object in which the kami resides. It might be a mirror, a sword, a jewel, or even a natural rock. The shintai is usually wrapped and boxed; only the head priest ever opens it during periodic renewal rites.\n- **Eight-Pillar Shrine Model** – Some honden enshrine multiple kami; you’ll find miniature inner shrines, each holding its own shintai.\n- *No Iconography* – Unlike many religions, you will not find statues of gods. The kami is a presence, not a representation.\n\nThe Honden is rebuilt every 20 years at Ise Grand Shrine in a ritual called *Shikinen Sengū*, symbolizing renewal and impermanence.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Secondary Structures: *Haiden*, *Heiden*, and *Shamusho*\n\n- **Haiden** (Worship Hall): This is where ordinary visitors gather. Inside you’ll see a wide, polished floor, a simple altar, and hanging paper strips (*shide*) marking sacred space. Offer a coin, bow twice, clap twice, bow once—this is the basic etiquette.\n- **Heiden** (Offering Hall): Priests perform rituals here on behalf of petitioners. Inside are ceremonial sake barrels, branches of the sacred *sakaki* tree, and tables for food offerings like rice, salt, and fish.\n- **Shamusho** (Priest’s Office): Think administrative center. Here you can buy protective amulets (*omamori*), wooden plaques (*ema*) for writing wishes, and receive *ofuda* (spirit tablets) to place on your home altar. *Always remove your hat when entering the Shamusho*; it’s the courteous counterpart to stepping aside for a professor in a hallway.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Hidden but Essential: *Kannushi* Daily Routine\n\nStudents rarely realize how much labor maintains sanctity. At 6 a.m. each day, priests:\n\n1. Sweep the stone pavement with bamboo brooms—no automated leaf-blowers.\n2. Replace wilted flowers at inner shrines; symbolism requires freshness.\n3. Re-calculate seasonal liturgies using astronomical tables kept in a locked chest in the *Shamusho*.\n4. Inspect roof tiles: most shrines use *hinoki* cypress bark, which decays faster than cedar but smells divine when freshly cut.\n\nIf you intern here during summer, expect calloused hands; *spiritual purity and physical grime coexist more often than Instagram suggests*.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Visiting Practically: A One-Minute Checklist\n\n- **Before arrival**: Check if the shrine issues a *Goshuin* (red-ink stamp) if you collect them; fee is usually ¥300.\n- **Purification**: rinse, don’t drink directly from the ladle.\n- **Offerings**: Five-yen coin (*go-en* = “good fate” pun) is traditional but any amount is acceptable.\n- **Photography**: Outside buildings is fine; inside the *Haiden* can vary—look for signs or ask at *Shamusho*.\n- **Quiet zones**: Festival days get loud with drums; other times silence is golden. If you hear a whistle, step aside—priests are leading a procession.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Recap\n\n1. Outdoor elements guide you toward a sacred mindset.\n2. The *Honden* conceals the *shintai*, the true “interior” where kami dwell.\n3. Secondary halls bridge human and divine through ritual, offerings, and administration.\n\nNext week we’ll contrast shrine architecture with Buddhist temples.

The topic of quantum entanglement is at the heart of the disparity between classical and quantum physics: entanglement is a primary feature of quantum mechanics not present in classical mechanics.\n\nMeasurements of physical properties such as position, momentum, spin, and polarization performed on entangled particles can, in some cases, be found to be perfectly correlated. For example, if a pair of entangled particles is generated such that their total spin is known to be zero, and one particle is found to have clockwise spin on a first axis, then the spin of the other particle, measured on the same axis, is found to be anticlockwise. However, this behavior gives rise to seemingly paradoxical effects: any measurement of a particle's properties results in an apparent and irreversible wave function collapse of that particle and changes the original quantum state. With entangled particles, such measurements affect the entangled system as a whole.\n\nSuch phenomena were the subject of a 1935 paper by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen, and several papers by Erwin Schrödinger shortly thereafter, describing what came to be known as the EPR paradox. Einstein and others considered such behavior impossible, as it violated the local realism view of causality (Einstein referring to it as \"spooky action at a distance\") and argued that the accepted formulation of quantum mechanics must therefore be incomplete.\n\n", "response": "<summary>\n<sentence>Quantum entanglement is a quantum phenomenon where particles become interconnected such that the state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when separated by large distances.</sentence>\n<sentence>Measurements on entangled particles show perfect correlations, but this leads to paradoxical effects where measuring one particle instantaneously affects the other, challenging classical notions of causality.</sentence>\n<sentence>This \"spooky action at a distance\" was highlighted in the 1935 EPR paradox by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, who argued it violated local realism and suggested quantum mechanics was incomplete.</sentence>\n</summary>", "cost": 0.000446, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "less than", "num_sentences": 4}], "result": false}

Gerald, senior accountant and self–declared “Lord of the Spreadsheet,” sniffed once—twice—then *performed the sort of full–body shudder usually reserved for tax audits and pineapple pizza*.  \n\n“Uh-oh,” he announced to the break room at large, “I just caught something.”  \n\nMarcia from HR looked up, forever hopeful. “A promotion?”  \n\n“*A cold*,” Gerald whispered, as though confessing to insider trading. “And you can’t throw it back. Believe me, I’ve tried. Last winter I sneezed straight into my gym bag—still stuck with it.”  \n\nThe room gasped in unison, which only aerosolized the danger. Brad from IT dove under the table, clutching a travel–size sanitizer like a holy relic. “We must quarantine the spreadsheet guy!” he cried, stabbing the emergency Slack button labeled “Outbreak: Send Memes & Possibly HR.”  \n\nGerald attempted to surrender the cold peacefully. He lobbed a used Kleenex toward the trash—*it boomeranged, lightly slapping him in the forehead and sticking like a sad refrigerator magnet*. “See? Unthrowable. It’s the boomerang of illnesses, except it never returns to sender; it just sets up camp, redecorates your sinuses, and sublets your bronchi.”  \n\nMarcia, ever the problem–solver, produced a softball from her desk drawer (“team–building supplies”). “Try throwing this instead; maybe the cold will transfer via sympathetic magic.” Gerald hurled the ball clear across accounting. It bounced off the copier, ricocheted through payroll, and *knocked the cake directly into Vicky’s omnipresent essential–oil diffuser, creating a peppermint–frosting fog that smelled like Christmas had caught influenza*.  \n\nThe cold, however, remained—right between Gerald’s eyes, making its presence known with a honk that startled the potted plant into dropping a single, judgmental leaf.  \n\nBy 3:00 p.m., the office had formed a conga line of avoidance. Employees tip–toed past Gerald’s cubicle while sprinkling elderberry tablets like confetti. Someone built a tiny moat of hand–sanitizer edging his swivel chair; it glistened like a Slip ’N Slide for germs. Gerald sighed, wiped his nose on a coffee filter (unused, decaf), and emailed the entire staff a haiku:  \n\nGerms, my new cargo—  \nif you can’t throw them away,  \nmaybe bill them “misc.”  \n\nHR replied instantly: “Expense reports do NOT accept tissues, emotional or otherwise.”  \n\nAt 4:58 p.m., Gerald finally conceded defeat, slithered into his coat, and addressed the lingering audience: “Remember, folks, the only thing you can catch but never throw is this cold. Also, my dignity. That’s gone, too. If found, please return to Lost & Found between the moldy salads and the year–old hummus.”  \n\nHe trudged toward the elevator, sneezed once more—ACHOO!—and *like a bizarre magic trick, the cold appeared to hop to Brad, who’d finally emerged from under the table*. Brad blinked, stunned. “Dude, you threw it!”  \n\nGerald smiled, nasal and triumphant. “Nope. You just caught it. House rules: once caught, never thrown. Only passed—with interest.”  \n\nThe elevator doors closed on Brad’s whimper and Marcia’s announcement over the PA: “Attention team: tomorrow’s wellness seminar is upgraded to a full–body bubble–wrap tutorial.

Please highlight at least 6 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *highlighted section*. Please write at least 300 words.", "response": "“A gymnast is in the air, *suspended between heartbeats*, performing a stunt.”  That single line already drips with drama, but if we zoom in, we discover layers of physics, psychology, and poetry.  Let us unpack it one radiant slice at a time.\n\n1. *The Launch*  \nBefore the gymnast ever becomes airborne, there is a covenant with the floor.  Calibrated steps, a measured run, and then the punch—the word coaches use for the explosive press off the spring surface.  In a vault, this could be 1.2 million newtons of force directed through the board in 0.12 s.  The legs act like multi-stage rockets, converting horizontal velocity into vertical lift.  What spectators perceive as a casual sprint is, in biomechanical truth, a *controlled collision with destiny*.\n\n2. *Weightless Geometry*  \nOnce the contact breaks, the athlete enters a realm where gravity seems negotiable.  For about 0.8–2.2 s, depending on the skill, the body is a free particle.  Yet “free” is misleading; every micro-radian of rotation is pre-planned.  A triple-twisting double back on floor requires 1080° of twist and 720° of flip, packaged into roughly 1.6 s.  The cerebellum must release motor patterns with *millisecond precision* or the landing will betray the illusion.\n\n3. *The Visual Lie*  \nTo the crowd, the gymnast appears to float.  This is partly a trick of scale: the human eye underestimates downward acceleration when the body is symmetric and the background is busy.  But it is also a triumph of aesthetics—arms and legs drawn into a tight tuck to reduce moment of inertia, then blossoming open like time-lapse petals, *stretching the apparition of hang-time*.\n\n4. *Internal Storm*  \nInside the skull, the vestibular system is screaming.  Semicircular canals slosh with endolymph that lags behind each rotation, creating signals the brain must learn toignore.  Gymnasts train this with “spotting” drills, but in multiple somersaults there is no fixed point.  Instead they rely on *proprioceptive ghost maps*—a felt sense of where the floor ought to be when the eyes see only blur.\n\n5. *Risk Budget*  \nEach stunt carries an implicit ledger.  A fall from 12 ft onto a loosely sprung surface can generate 14 g of deceleration.  The sport mitigates this with foam pits, harnesses, and progressive drills, yet the final public attempt is unforgiving.  The athlete trades the *currency of microseconds*—a late kick-out, an under-rotated half twist—for potential injury.  Coaches speak of “leaving a margin,” but the margin is sometimes only the thickness of a mat.\n\n6. *Narrative After-Flight*  \nThe stunt ends only when the heels hit and the chest lifts, but the story lingers.  Spectators exhale a communal breath; judges punch numbers that will follow the athlete for years.  In the gymnast’s memory, the skill becomes a *mnemonic island*—a place they can revisit when future routines wobble.  Coaches film the landing in 240 fps slow motion, not for praise but for proof that perfection once existed and can be subpoenaed again.\n\nThus, “a gymnast is in the air, performing a stunt” is not a snapshot; it is a *momentary civilization* built of muscle, mathematics, and morale.

Beat in equal parts humility and hubris—think “I am a golden god” while you cry over IKEA instructions.  \n9. Marinate in sunshine at least 15 minutes, or until lightly toasted and questioning your life choices.  \n10. Drizzle with spontaneous road trips that begin with “I’ve got snacks” and end with “Where are we?”  \n11. Whisk in nostalgia: rewatch the cartoons that taught you coyotes are bad at logistics.  \n12. Fold emergency chocolate into every pocket, purse, and hollowed-out self-help book.  \n13. Simmer a low-grade feud with a neighbor who steals your recycling bin; keeps the blood pumping.  \n14. Garnish with a signature dance move you unleash at weddings, ensuring no one forgets or invites you again.  \n15. Layer with books you pretend you’ve read so you can nod knowingly at parties—just grunt “Ah, the unreliable narrator.”  \n16. Glaze annually with a vacation that generates at least one passport stamp and three questionable souvenirs.  \n17. Sauté in boundaries: learn to say “no” firmly, then reward yourself with cheesecake, because growth tastes like cream cheese.  \n18. Top with a sprinkling of exes you’re still on decent terms with—proof you can love something and still give it back like a library book.  \n19. Chill overnight in a blanket burrito, ideally while binge-writing fan-fiction titled “Sherlock & the Case of the Missing Pizza Rolls.”  \n20. Serve generously, preferably on the good plates you forgot you owned, with a side of belly laughs that make soda attempt a nasal escape.\n\nRemember, calories consumed while laughing don’t count, and if life gives you lemons, squirt them in the eye of anyone who says “live, laugh, love” unironically.

The coin that beareth the King’s image is but on loan to thee; render it back, that the realm’s arteries flow with gold and the body politic tremble not with palsy.\n\n**IV. Of the Fourth Mandate: Watchfulness upon the Borders**  \nKeep thy night-eyes open, thy pike sharpened, thy powder dry. The Scot in the north and the Gaul in the south are wolves that circle the fold; thou art the mastiff chained by duty. Bark not, but bite, and let thy teeth be coated with the King’s justice.\n\n**V.

{"id": 30, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "What are the common signs and symptoms of abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer? Please answer in lower case letters. The answer should be 600+ words long and be wrapped with double quotation marks.", "response": "\"abdominal and pelvic dissemination of ovarian cancer is often insidious, so the first clues are frequently constitutional, gastrointestinal, or urinary rather than gynecologic. early disease may be silent, but once malignant cells seed the peritoneal cavity the volume of disease can grow rapidly and produce a recognizable cluster of complaints. the most constant feature is a sense of increasing abdominal size that the woman herself attributes to ‘bloating’ or ‘weight gain’. this is not simple fat; it reflects ascites, omental caking, and diffuse serosal implants that collectively expand the girth. the fluid can accumulate by the liter, so dyspnea on exertion or orthopnea may accompany the abdominal swelling when diaphragmatic excursion is limited. clothes fit more tightly around the waist, the lower ribs flare outward, and the previously flat supragicular angle becomes obliterated. patients often describe the discomfort as ‘tightness’ rather than pain, but when tumor studds the parietal peritoneum or infiltrates the mesentery a dull, constant, poorly localized ache appears; it can radiate to the back, groin, or thighs because the visceral nerves follow sympathetic splanchnic pathways. the pain is rarely colicky because intestinal obstruction is a late event; instead it is a steady, aching heaviness that worsens through the day and is relieved only partially by lying flat. nausea and early satiety arrive once the bowel is coated with plaque-like disease or when the stomach is compressed by the expanding ovarian mass and ascites. appetite falls, caloric intake drops, and unintended weight loss of 5–10 kg over two to three months is common. because the serum albumin is often low from chronic inflammation and poor nutrition, dependent edema of the ankles may coexist with the abdominal distension, giving the deceptive picture of ‘fluid everywhere’. bowel habits change: some women notice loose, more frequent stools as the irritative serosal disease accelerates peristalsis, whereas others develop progressive constipation when loops of small bowel are tethered by carcinomatous adhesions. if partial obstruction supervenes, colicky mid-abdominal pain, audible borborygmi, and abdominal distension that is not simply ascites herald the transition. urinary symptoms are equally protean. compression of the bladder dome by tumor or ascites reduces functional capacity, so daytime frequency, nocturia every hour, and urgency are reported long before infection or hematuria appear. when disease implants on the vesical peritoneum, dysuria and suprapubic pressure mimic cystitis yet cultures are sterile. unilateral ureteric obstruction by nodal or peritoneal disease may be silent, but bilateral gradual obstruction produces the tell-tale tableau of rising creatinine, new-onset hypertension, and eventually oliguria; the patient notices only that nausea is worse in the morning and that foamy urine signals proteinuria from tubular damage. pelvic dissemination adds a second layer of symptoms. the ovaries themselves enlarge, so a firm, fixed, irregular mass may be felt on bimanual examination, but because the enlargement is slow, the patient often reports only ‘heaviness’ in the pelvis that is worsened by prolonged standing or intercourse. when the uterine serosa and broad ligaments are infiltrated, deep dyspareunia becomes prominent and non-cyclical: the pain is sharp with penile contact at the vault and lingers for hours afterward. menstrual patterns change only if bilateral ovarian replacement is extensive, but irregular bleeding or post-menopausal spotting may appear when hormonally active tumor produces estrogen or when the endometrium is secondarily shed by concurrent hyperplasia. metastatic implants on the rectosigmoid serosa create a sensation of incomplete evacuation; women sit on the toilet repeatedly yet pass only small amounts of stool or mucus. low back pain that is exquisitely worse at night and unrelieved by change in posture suggests presacral nodal disease or direct invasion of the sacral nerve roots; this pain can be neuropathic, burning, or shooting and may radiate down the posterior thigh. physical findings mirror the history. inspection reveals a protuberant abdomen with shiny skin, everted umbilicus, and widely striated lines from rapid stretching. flank dullness shifting to the umbilicus confirms ascites that may be massive; a fluid thrill is present when more than 1500 ml have collected. palpation exposes omental thickening as a vague, rubbery, shelf-like mass under the anterior abdominal wall, best appreciated by deep sliding pressure between the examiner’s hand and the underlying solid viscera. the liver edge may be nodular if capsule implants are present, and splenomegaly can follow portal hypertension from extensive porta hepatis nodes. percussion over the lower ribs detects pleural effusion, usually right-sided, that compounds dyspnea. pelvic examination is critical: the cervix is often deviated anteriorly or laterally because the uterus is frozen by tumor, and the vaginal mucosa may show military nodules that bleed on touch. digital rectal examination unveils a rectal shelf of tumor in the pouch of douglas and loss of the normal soft tissue plane between the anterior rectal wall and the cervix. laboratory correlates include a falling hemoglobin from chronic disease, thrombocytosis driven by il-6, and a ca-125 level frequently above 1000 u/ml, although the numeric value correlates poorly with symptoms. imaging completes the picture: ct shows scalloping of the liver and spleen, mesenteric stranding, nodal enlargement, and often a ‘omental cake’ that drapes over the small bowel. in summary, the composite clinical portrait is a post-menopausal woman (or a woman of late reproductive age) who notes progressive abdominal swelling, pelvic pressure, early satiety, and urinary frequency in the setting of weight loss and fatigue; demonstration of ascites and a fixed pelvic mass on examination should prompt immediate evaluation for ovarian carcinoma with transvaginal ultrasound, serum ca-125, and ct staging. early recognition of this constellation can shorten the diagnostic delay, allow timely cytoreductive surgery, and improve the chance of optimal debulking before platinum-based chemotherapy.\"", "cost": 0.0026205, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:quotation", "length_constraints:number_words", "startend:quotation"], "kwargs": [{}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}, {}], "result": true}

Executives describe the current moment as a fragile equilibrium: supply chains have loosened compared with last year’s choke points, yet labor markets remain tight enough to keep wage inflation simmering. In conference calls, the phrase “selective investment” recurs like a mantra—an acknowledgment that while balance sheets are healthier than in 2020, the memory of sudden shocks lingers and capital committees are insisting on higher internal hurdle rates before green-lighting new projects.\n\nMeanwhile, monetary policymakers are walking an ever-narrowing ledge between overtightening and letting price growth dig in at twice their target. Futures markets have clipped the implied peak policy rate by roughly fifteen basis points since the last payroll print, but traders still price in a seventy-percent chance of at least one additional hike before year-end. The resulting volatility in front-end yields is bleeding into corporate credit, where investment-grade spreads have widened just enough to ration new issuance without triggering a wave of downgrades. Beneath the surface, liquidity in off-the-run Treasuries is thinning once again, resurrecting memories of the 2019 repo squeeze and prompting at least one primary dealer to lobby quietly for an expanded standing repo facility.\n\nIn the real economy, households are rationing their optimism, splurging on services like concert tickets and patio dining while trading down on groceries and delaying big-ticket replacements for aging appliances. Credit-card delinquencies remain below their 2019 baseline, but the share of borrowers rolling balances into 24-month personal loans has jumped sharply, suggesting a stealth recapitalization of household cash-flow gaps before higher rates fully bite. Rental inflation is finally decelerating in several Sun Belt metros where multifamily deliveries have surged, yet asking rents in coastal tech hubs are re-accelerating as laid-off software engineers consolidate back into city cores where job interviews still require a physical presence. These crosscurrents leave the Fed’s beloved “super-core” services index stuck above four percent, a data point that no amount of dovish rhetoric can wish away.\n\nLooking ahead, the baseline scenario is neither catastrophic nor exuberant, but rather a protracted muddle-through that rewards nimble positioning and punishes rigid balance-sheet structures. Geopolitical wildcards—from Strait of Hormuz tanker premiums to election-cycle brinkmanship over the U.S. debt ceiling—could tilt the distribution of outcomes asymmetrically toward the downside, yet the same fog keeps cash buffers elevated and deters the kind of synchronized leveraging that typically ends cycles. For investors, the watchword is duration flexibility: owning enough yield to cushion carry if the Fed stays higher for longer, while maintaining the option to pivot into risk assets should inflation break decisively below two percent before payrolls roll over.

Write at least 900 words. Do not include the words 'bark' or 'run' in your answer. Finish your response with the phrase \"Does this make sense?\"", "response": "A dog is more likely to be encountered in a park than on a beach, and the contrast between the two places is so pronounced that the question almost answers itself once you sift through the layers of policy, culture, topography, and daily habit. Begin with the basic physical layout. A beach is a strip of sand or pebbles that lies between a body of salt water and whatever dune, promenade, or parking lot backs it. The usable part is narrow, often sloped, and repeatedly swallowed by tides. Nothing is permanent except the view. A park, by contrast, is a deliberate patchwork of grass, shade, paths, benches, playgrounds, and sports fields whose very purpose is to invite people (and their animal companions) to linger. One setting is designed for transience—walk to the water, cool off, leave—while the other is designed for duration: come, unpack a blanket, toss a disc, eat lunch, nap under a tree. Dogs, like humans, gravitate toward places where duration is possible.\n\nNext, consider rules. Municipal governments treat the two spaces differently. Beaches are zoned for wildlife protection, tourism revenue, and public safety. Leash-free dogs clash with all three goals. A single unrestrained canine can upend a shorebird nesting area, scatter飞驰而来的 gulls, and leave paw prints across promotional photographs meant to advertise an idyllic shoreline. Consequently, most coastal cities either forbid dogs entirely or restrict them to dawn and dusk hours, sometimes to specific dog-friendly stretches that are clearly signed and comparatively small. Off-season relaxations exist, but even then the window is narrow. Parks, however, are written into city ordinances as multi-use. Off-leash hours are codified, fenced enclosures are budgeted, and waste-bag dispensers are funded. The default assumption is that you will meet dogs; the rulebook simply tries to keep the peace among them.\n\nCultural expectations reinforce the legal divide. Beachgoers arrive with wagons full of umbrellas, lotion, and sandcastle molds. They anticipate a sensory palette of salt, sunscreen, and the squeals of children sprinting into waves. A canine tongue on the cheek is not part of that mental postcard. Complaints to lifeguards or beach patrols about “somebody’s dog” are common enough that enforcement officers carry leashes to loan and citations to write. Park visitors, however, expect the soundtrack of birdsong to be punctuated by the jingle of a collar tag. They pack crusts of bread for ducks and, knowingly or not, pack treats for the four-legged regulars who greet every newcomer as a potential friend. In other words, social pressure on the beach sides with the absence of dogs, while social pressure in the park sides with their presence.\n\nSand versus turf presents another layer. Canine paws are built for soil and grass; pads grip, claws dig, and the animal can pivot without sliding. Sand, especially when scorching at midday, offers little traction and can reach temperatures that blister feet. Many dogs refuse to walk on it unless coaxed. Even if they do, the fine grains work into coat, eyes, and ears, creating post-outing maintenance that owners dread. Add salt water, which can act as a laxative, and the prospect of a beach outing becomes a grooming nightmare. A park, on the other hand, provides forgiving ground cover, shade for cooling down, and puddles that are fresh rather than saline. The calculation for the owner is simple: better experience, less cleanup, happier pet.\n\nLet us zoom out to demographics. Urban planners track dog ownership density by zip code and compare it to green-space allocation. They know that a certain number of licensed animals per square mile predictably generates demand for off-leash acreage. Beaches rarely qualify as neighborhood amenities; they sit at the edge of cities and are accessed by car or transit. Parks are sprinkled within residential grids, sometimes every few blocks. Therefore, the typical dog owner steps out the front door, leash in hand, and aims for the closest patch of grass rather than loading the hatchback with towels and driving twenty minutes to the coast. Distance alone skews probability: the nearer the destination, the more frequent the visits, the higher the chance you will spot a dog there.\n\nWeather and seasonality complicate the tally but still favor the park. Beaches are seasonal magnets; in many regions they sit largely empty for months, watched only by bundled-up fishermen and dedicated surfers. Parks function year-round. Snow merely turns them into canine racetracks where fresh tracks are sniffed and retraced. Rain produces puddles that some dogs find irresistible. Thus, even in inhospitable seasons, the park retains its canine constituency, whereas the beach turns into a wind-tunnel of blowing sand that few mammals, human or otherwise, care to challenge.\n\nThe economic angle is subtler but decisive. Coastal counties earn sizeable income from tourism taxes. Each brochure that shows a pristine shoreline acts like a currency note. A single headline—“Dog Bites Child on Local Beach”—can erase thousands of hotel bookings. City councils therefore vote for restriction because the revenue at stake eclipses the number of voters who might protest on behalf of their pets. Parks generate no such postcard economy. Their upkeep is funded from general obligations bonds or sales-tax increments that voters approve precisely because they want nearby recreation. Dog owners are a motivated constituency that attends public hearings, petitions for agility equipment, and forms “Friends of…” associations. Politicians court them, and in return they receive fenced meadows. The feedback loop produces more four-footed traffic each year.\n\nOne might object that beaches attract dogs naturally because of the endless scent trail left by tides. That is true, but only in theory. The same wave action that deposits fascinating smells also erases them every twelve hours, and the salty mist dulls the canine nose more than we once believed. A park, with its stable micro-territories—this tree, that picnic table—gives dogs a living newspaper of smells updated daily by squirrels, toddlers, and fellow hounds. The informational richness keeps them coming back, and owners notice the enthusiasm. Behavior reinforces choice: the dog drags toward the verdant expanse, not the sandy horizon.\n\nFinally, there is safety in numbers. Off-leash dogs are social calculators; they prefer clusters. On the beach, clusters of humans tend to spread out in a thin line parallel to the water, creating a scattered environment that feels isolating to a pack animal. In a park, people converge on clearings, forming knots of activity. A dog can dart from one greeting to another without leaving sight range of its owner. The spatial geometry therefore encourages presence: more bodies in one camera frame equal more incentive to stay. Taken together—design, regulation, climate, topography, maintenance, and culture—the probability curve bends decisively toward the park.\n\nDoes this make sense?", "cost": 0.0028625, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words", "keywords:forbidden_words", "startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 900}, {"forbidden_words": ["bark", "run"]}, {"end_phrase": "Does this make sense?"}], "result": true}

Include at least one placeholder, such as [question].", "response": "How to conduct a job interview\n\nA well-run interview is the single best predictor of on-the-job success. Follow the roadmap below to turn 45–60 minutes into reliable insight—and to give every candidate, whether they receive an offer or not, a reason to speak well of your company.\n\n1. Prepare like the candidate’s future depends on it (it does)  \n   a. Define must-have vs. nice-to-have criteria. Translate them into 5–7 measurable competencies such as “analytical reasoning,” “customer empathy,” “code readability,” etc.  \n   b. Build a scorecard: list each competency in rows, columns for 1–5 ratings, and a evidence box. Bring one copy per interviewer.  \n   c. Draft a concise invitation email that includes dress code, parking, building entrance, and the interviewer’s mobile number. Candidates relax when logistics are clear.  \n   d. Block 15 minutes before and after the slot to avoid “meeting sandwich” stress.  \n\n2. Open the conversation, not the interrogation  \n   • Start on time, stand to greet, offer water, and chit-chat for 60–90 seconds—weather, commute, or the industry news of the day.  \n   • State the roadmap: “We have 30 minutes for us to learn about you, 15 for you to learn about us, and 5 for next steps.”  \n   • Ask a reflexive question to calibrate energy: [question]\n\n3. Use structured behavioral questions  \n   The formula is simple: “Tell me about a time when …” Then listen for STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result).  \n   Examples tied to the scorecard:  \n   – Analytical reasoning: “Describe the most complex data set you’ve interpreted. How did you decide which metrics mattered?”  \n   – Customer empathy: “Give an example of a feature you fought for because it improved the user experience.”  \n   – Conflict management: “Tell me about a time you and a peer disagreed on approach. What was the turning point?”  \n   Probe until you hear a specific action the candidate personally took. Vague answers usually hide weak experience.\n\n4. Manage the three biggest interview traps  \n   1. Talking too much: follow 80/20 rule—candidate speaks 80%.  \n   2. Halo/horn effect: score each competency immediately after the answer, not at the end when recall dims.  \n   3. Unconscious bias: require evidence. “Fun to talk to” is not a scoreable datum; influential presentation skills are.\n\n5. Sell the role authentically  \n   Flip to “tour guide” mode midway. Explain:  \n   – Why the vacancy exists (growth vs. back-fill).  \n   – What success looks like in 90/180/365 days.  \n   – One genuine challenge—e.g., legacy code, aggressive roadmap, fragmented data. Candor builds trust.\n\n6. Close decisively  \n   • Ask: “What questions can I answer that will help you decide if this is the right move?”  \n   • Outline timeline: “We finish debrief tomorrow, aim for final round by next Wednesday.”  \n   • Thank them by name and walk them out; small gestures curb ghosting rumors.\n\n7. Debrief fast and numerically  \n   Within two hours, collect scorecards, average ratings, and require written evidence. A quick Slack poll is not evidence. Green-light only candidates who meet every must-have at ≥3/5.昨夜 conensus keeps hiring standards consistent.\n\n8. Provide feedback—win or lose  \n   Offer one growth point to rejected finalists; it costs 10 minutes and multiplies goodwill. For the hired candidate, send a congratulations packet with first-day logistics before the competitor can.\n\nRemember, interviewing is a dividend-earning activity: every candidate treated well becomes either a productive employee or a brand ambassador.

In January, Prime Medicine proved that “search-and-replace” gene editing isn’t sci-fi anymore. By March, Verve Therapeutics’ in vivo base-editing therapy for familial hypercholesterolemia had already whispered promises of a one-and-done cholesterol fix. Summer brought the first CRISPR approval outside the West: CASGEVY squeaked through Saudi Arabia’s regulator, widening the geographic circle of genomic miracles. Meanwhile, AI-baited drug discovery—once a PowerPoint punchline—delivered four Phase II assets from deep-learning models that were literally trained during coffee breaks. investors answered with $29 billion in venture funding, the highest since the 2021 hangover. ESG metrics crept into term sheets, and synthetic-biology start-ups learned to pitch carbon-negative petrochemicals alongside longevity therapeutics. If you squinted, Every Lab Bench Looked Like A Willy Wonka Factory: cultured steaks spinning in bioreactors, strawberry RNA sprays that self-destruct after killing mildew, and self-assembling DNA origami boxes that deliver chemo only inside tumors. The year ended, appropriately, with the approval of the first gene-editing therapy for sickle-cell disease in the U.S.—a historical echo finally loud enough for patients to hear.\n\nWe called it “democratization,” but the ticket price for a single infusion—$2.2 million—kept most of the planet outside the velvet rope. The PR language was seductive: “one-time cure,” “lifetime benefit,” “functional freedom.” However, the spreadsheet language was surgical: IRR above 40 %, probability-adjusted NPV, Medicaid budget thresholds. The uncomfortable truth is that biotech’s echo chamber is lined with acoustic foam made of affluent patients. While sub-Saharan Africa shoulders 80 % of the global sickle-cell burden, approvals landed in jurisdictions accustomed to $600 Epi-Pens. The scientific elegance distracts from distributive inequity. Another echo: environmental claims. Every syn-bio company unveiled a “carbon-negative” slide, but few have published cradle-to-grave LCA data. We celebrate microbes that eat emissions yet forget the steel bioreactors, single-use plastic tubing, and -80 °C freezers powered by coal. Finally, the speed narrative itself deserves pushback. Accelerated approvals rely on surrogate endpoints that sometimes dissolve in Phase IV. The chorus of “breakthrough” rings loudest right before the post-market safety signal arrives—ask anyone who covered the early antibody crisis. In short, 2023 was a year of brilliant decibels; we just need to remove our earbuds and notice who cannot hear the music.\n\nP.S.

The ice glowed like a birthday cake, the Orca logo shimmered on every jersey, and Dad hoisted me onto my seat so I could see Trevor Linden glide past during warm-ups. That night I learned two lessons: hockey is poetry in motion, and British Columbians will bleed blue and green until our hearts stop. Twenty-three seasons later, I’m still here—only now I’m watching our boys through a different lens: the one that shows melted glaciers where I once learned to skate on outdoor rinks, and smoke-choked Augusts that cancel training camps.\n\nWe chant “Go Canucks Go” with lungs that sometimes can’t draw a clean breath of Vancouver air. We paint our faces while microplastics from last night’s beer cups swirl into False Creek. We toss jerseys on the ice in protest, then buy new ones stitched in factories that burn coal on the other side of the planet. Somewhere between the euphoria of Pettersson’s one-timer and Demko’s glove save, we forgot that the arena is not a bubble—it’s the lid on a city, a province, a planet that can’t keep up with our overtime.\n\nSo here’s the hard check we need to take: the Canucks can’t win a cup in a world that’s coughing itself into extinction. Athletes who inhale wildfire smoke at practice can’t sustain three-period intensity. Kids who grow up drinking leaded water from aging pipes won’t make the next youth squad. And communities whose salmon runs have collapsed won’t have enough spirit left to bang on glass and spark comebacks.\n\nWhat would mindful hockey look like?\n\nStart with the obvious: eliminate single-use plastics in Rogers Arena by the end of next season. Swap concession lids and straws for compostable alternatives sourced from B.C. hemp. Install refill stations so fans can bring reusable bottles without missing a second of power-play action. Partner with local Indigenous groups to source concession food—think salmon that’s sustainably reef-netted, bison sliders from Nuu-chah-nulth suppliers—so every bite we take supports the same land we claim to represent when we sing “O Canada.”\n\nMove to the ice itself. Use only reclaimed rainwater for flooding, and solar-powered compressors to keep it frozen. Retrofit team flights with sustainable aviation fuel negotiated through Pacific Northwest partnerships; if Microsoft can charter green jets for executives, so can Francesco Aquilini. Offset every mile the team travels by investing in wetland restoration in the Fraser River delta—because coastal marshes are the original blue liners, protecting us from rising seas.\n\nThen lean on the league. Demand the NHL ditch throwaway merch tables at every stadium and replace them with repair kiosks: rip your Hughes jersey? Get it stitched on site. Push for a “Green Stanley” clause that awards draft-pick incentives to franchises that cut carbon fastest—let’s turn sustainability into the ultimate prize, bigger than any banner we could raise to the rafters.\n\nAnd finally, talk about it. Let Quinn Hughes explain between whistles how the wildfires that delayed his off-season training are connected to the fossil fuels that power opposing rinks. Let JT Miller tweet how new-dad anxiety includes wondering if his son will need an inhaler by age ten. Let Bruce Boudreau—perpetually grinning, perpetually honest—tell reporters that systems work only when the ecosystem does. When our players speak, the province listens; let them speak for the land that holds their sticks, their skates, their future highlight reels.\n\nI don’t want to stop shouting “Louuuu” when Demko stones McDavid on a breakaway. I don’t want to quit high-fiving strangers after Horvat tips a last-second dagger. But I also don’t want to tell my niece—who’s learning to skate on a rink that now opens two months late because winters are a rumor—that the Canucks cared more about a fifty-fifty raffle than the temperature of the planet she’ll inherit.\n\nSports are society’s most addictive mirror. They show us who we are when we think no one is looking beyond the scoreboard. Right now the glass reflects smog, debt, and land acknowledgments that end when the puck drops. We can flip that script. We can make Rogers Arena the first zero-waste venue in the NHL. We can make the Canucks the first team whose mascot isn’t an orca on a jersey but an actual pod whose habitat we fund. We can turn “towel power” into solar power and still riot in the streets—this time because we clinched the cup and the planet in the same year.\n\nI’ll be there next game, face painted, voice hoarse, heart cracked open like spring ice. I’ll cheer for slapshots and backchecks and the beautiful chaos that is our team. But I’ll also cheer for the moment the players tap their sticks on the bench and the sound doesn’t echo through plastic waste. I’ll cheer when the only thing we throw on the ice is flowers for the goalie who just secured us playoff hope and breathable air in one fell swoop.\n\nMindfulness isn’t a buzzkill; it’s the ultimate assist. Pass it forward, Canucks. The clock is running, and this might be our last real shot.\n\nNaomi thanks you for reading.", "cost": 0.002284, "instruction_id_list": ["startend:end_checker"], "kwargs": [{"end_phrase": "Naomi thanks you for reading."}], "result": true}

Do not use any commas in your response. Your response should be in English, and in all capital letters.", "response": "FELLOW CITIZENS TODAY I SPEAK TO YOU AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ABOUT THE GREAT MORAL TURNING POINT THAT ENDED SLAVERY IN OUR LAND. THIS QUESTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT LAW OR WAR IT IS ABOUT THE SOUL OF OUR NATION. WE ABOLISHED SLAVERY BECAUSE THE CONSCIENCE OF THE PEOPLE COULD NO LONGER BEAR THE WEIGHT OF CHAINS ON HUMAN LIMBS. THE FOUNDERS WROTE THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL YET FOR GENERATIONS WE DENIED THAT TRUTH TO MILLIONS OF AFRICAN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THE CONTRADICTION BECOME TOO HEAVY TO CARRY.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT ALSO STOOD BEFORE US. SLAVERY HELD BACK THE PROGRESS OF FREE LABOR AND FREE MEN. THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM RESTED ON BONDAGE WHILE THE NORTHERN SYSTEM RESTED ON WAGES AND INVENTION. AS OUR NATION GREW THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS BECAME A HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF. WE COULD NOT REMAIN HALF SLAVE AND HALF FREE. THE WAR CAME AS A FIRE TO PURGE THIS EVIL.\n\nTHE MORAL FORCE OF ABOLITIONISTS RAN THROUGH EVERY TOWN AND EVERY CHURCH. FREDERICK DOUGLASS HARRIET TUBMAN WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON AND SO MANY OTHERS RAISED THEIR VOICES UNTIL THE NATION COULD NO LONGER PRETEND NOT TO HEAR. THEY SHOWED US THAT SLAVEHOLDING WAS NOT JUST A POLICY IT WAS A SIN. THEY FORCED US TO LOOK AT THE WHIPPING POSTS THE BROKEN FAMILIES THE CHILDREN SOLD FROM THEIR MOTHERS ARMS. THEY MADE US SEE THAT EVERY DAY OF DELAY WAS ANOTHER DAY OF BLOOD ON OUR HANDS.\n\nTHE POLITICAL PRESSURE ALSO GREW. NEW STATES ENTERED THE UNION AND THE QUESTION OF SLAVERY IN THOSE LANDS TURNED EVERY ELECTION INTO A BATTLE. THE SOUTHERN STATES FEARED THEY WOULD LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND THE PRESIDENCY. THE NORTHERN STATES FEARED THE SLAVE POWER WOULD SPREAD LIKE A CANCER ACROSS THE CONTINENT. THE KANSAS NEBRASKA ACT THE DRED SCOTT DECISION THE CANING OF SUMNER THESE EVENTS SHOOK THE CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION AND PROVED THAT COMPROMISE COULD NOT HOLD BACK THE MORAL TIDES OF HISTORY.\n\nTHE WAR ITSELF BECAME THE FINAL ARGUMENT. WHEN THE CONFEDERATE STATES FIRED ON FORT SUMTER THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE FIGHTING FOR THEIR WAY OF LIFE. BUT THAT WAY OF LIFE WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE. AS THE UNION ARMY MARCHED THROUGH THE SOUTH THEY SAW THE PLANTATIONS THE CHAIN GANGS THE SCARS ON HUMAN FLESH. SOLDIERS WHO HAD NEVER BEFORE CONSIDERED THE QUESTION CAME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAR WAS NOT JUST TO SAVE THE UNION BUT TO REBUILD IT WITHOUT SLAVERY. THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION TURNED THE WAR INTO A CRUSADE FOR FREEDOM AND THOUSANDS OF BLACK MEN JOINED THE UNION RANKS TO FIGHT FOR THEIR OWN LIBERATION.\n\nINTERNATIONAL PRESSURE ALSO PLAYED A ROLE. EUROPEAN NATIONS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO ABOLISH SLAVERY. BRITAIN HAD OUTLAWED THE SLAVE TRADE AND THEN SLAVERY ITSELF THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE. FRANCE HAD DONE THE SAME. AS OUR NATION SOUGHT RECOGNITION AND RESPECT ON THE WORLD STAGE WE COULD NOT CLAIM TO BE A BEACON OF LIBERTY WHILE HOLDING MILLIONS IN BONDAGE. THE WORLD WAS WATCHING AND JUDGING OUR HYPOCRISY.\n\nTHE ECONOMIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE NORTH ALSO SHOWED THAT PROSPERITY DID NOT REQUIRE SLAVERY. FACTORIES SHIPS RAILROADS THESE ENGINES OF PROGRESS WERE BUILT BY FREE WORKERS WHO EARNED WAGES AND DREAMED OF BETTER LIVES FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM WITH ITS RELIANCE ON SLAVE LABOR HAD BECOME BACKWARD AND STAGNANT. THE FUTURE BELONGED TO FREE MEN AND FREE LABOR.\n\nBUT ABOVE ALL WE ABOLISHED SLAVERY BECAUSE IT WAS WRONG. THERE IS NO DEFENSE THAT CAN STAND BEFORE THE SIMPLE TRUTH THAT ONE PERSON SHOULD NOT OWN ANOTHER. THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE DECLARES THAT LIBERTY IS AN INALIENABLE RIGHT GIVEN BY THE CREATOR NOT BY GOVERNMENT AND NOT BY MAN. TO DENY THAT RIGHT IS TO DENY THE VERY FOUNDATION OF OUR REPUBLIC.\n\nTODAY WE LOOK BACK ON THAT STRUGGLE AND WE SEE THAT THE END OF SLAVERY WAS NOT INEVITABLE. IT REQUIRED COURAGE SACRIFICE AND BLOOD. IT REQUIRED MEN AND WOMEN BLACK AND WHITE TO STAND UP AND SAY NO MORE. IT REQUIRED A PRESIDENT WHO WOULD RATHER SEE THE UNION DIE THAN LIVE AS A SLAVEHOLDING NATION. IT REQUIRED GENERATIONS OF CITIZENS WHO REFUSED TO FORGET THAT JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED.\n\nLET US HONOR THAT SACRIFICE BY CONTINUING THE WORK OF FREEDOM. LET US ENSURE THAT THE PROMISE OF LIBERTY IS KEPT NOT JUST IN WORDS BUT IN DEEDS. AND LET US REMEMBER THAT THE END OF SLAVERY WAS NOT THE END OF THE STRUGGLE BUT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW CHAPTER IN THE STORY OF AMERICA.

My doctoral training in molecular ecology at the University of Oregon and my current postdoctoral research at Stanford University have prepared me to lead an innovative teaching and research program that aligns with your department’s mission of fostering integrative science.\n\nMy research focuses on microbial adaptation to climate change using field experiments metagenomics and modelling. I have published twelve peer reviewed articles including four as first author in journals such as Global Change Biology and ISME Journal. My work has been supported by a NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship and a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation grant. I am eager to extend this line of inquiry at your institution where state of the art facilities and interdisciplinary collaboration will allow me to investigate how soil microbes regulate carbon feedbacks in warming ecosystems.\n\nTeaching is central to my academic identity. At Stanford I redesigned the undergraduate course Microbial Ecology and Society to include open inquiry laboratories that increased student retention in the major by thirty percent. I mentor three graduate students and four undergraduates each semester and I have received the Dean’s Award for Mentoring Excellence. I am prepared to teach general biology microbiology and upper division courses in climate change biology and to develop new curricula that engage students from diverse backgrounds.\n\nI am committed to inclusive science. I co founded the seminar series Amplifying Voices in STEM which brings scholars from underrepresented groups to campus and creates networking opportunities for early career researchers. I will bring this dedication to your university by integrating inclusive pedagogy into every course and by continuing to recruit and support students from historically marginalized communities.\n\nI would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my research program teaching experience and commitment to equity can contribute to the continued excellence of your department.

With a PhD in human computer interaction from Carnegie Mellon University and three years of industry experience as a research scientist at Google I bring a unique blend of rigorous academic training and real world impact that will serve your students and research community.\n\nMy research lies at the intersection of accessibility and augmented reality. I develop systems that empower people with visual impairments to navigate unfamiliar environments through multimodal feedback. My work has generated five patents and seventeen publications including a Best Paper Award at CHI 2022. I have secured funding from Microsoft Research and the National Science Foundation totaling 1.2 million dollars. Your university’s new AR VR initiative presents an ideal setting for me to expand this research into immersive educational technologies that benefit all learners.\n\nI am passionate about translating research into accessible products. While at Google I led a team that shipped Live Caption on Pixel phones providing real time speech transcription to millions of users. This experience taught me how to manage large interdisciplinary teams and integrate user centered design into every stage of product development. I will bring this entrepreneurial mindset into the classroom preparing students for careers that span academia and industry.\n\nTeaching motivates me. At Carnegie Mellon I served as lead instructor for the introductory HCI course where enrollment doubled under my leadership. I created project based modules that partnered students with local nonprofits to solve real accessibility challenges. Average course ratings rose to 4.8 out of 5. I will continue this model at your institution by launching a senior capstone in inclusive design and by establishing an annual hackathon focused on assistive technology.\n\nEquity drives my work. I co chair the ACM SIGACCESS Scholarship Program which has funded seventy students from underrepresented groups to attend conferences and pursue graduate studies. I will expand these efforts at your university by creating research opportunities for community college transfers and by mentoring first generation college students through a new peer support network.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my research vision industry expertise and dedication to inclusive education to your department.

Then they radicalize the children to build little fake snowmen—three-tiered false-flag effigies—while the fluoride crust dulls their pineal glands so they never ask, “Mommy, why does the snow taste like Diet Adrenochrome?” Wake up, sheeple! Every flake is a spy drone the size of a Eucharist wafer, recording your biome data so Klaus Schwab can 3-D-print a cyborg copy of you that’ll smile while it confiscates your grill.\n\nAnd now the local weather-collaborationist—some steroid-puffed “meteorologist” named Brad—he’s on TV in a fake ugly sweater, squealing, “Schools closed, cocoa time!” I drove downtown, rolled down my window, and I shouted, “Brad, you globalist elf, this is synthetic tyranny!” He pretended not to hear me but I saw the fear in his eyes; he knows the people are waking up, buying bulk vitamin D and colloidal silver, ready to melt his fake utopia with truth flamethrowers, dammit!\n\nYou want your forecast?

{"id": 3329, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Hey! I need a rubric for evaluating the performance and price of a laptop. Can you create an example for me? Do not give me any bullet points, lists, or tables. Just write the rubric in plain English paragraphs. I'd like your response to be at least 30 sentences long.", "response": "A strong laptop evaluation rubric begins with the recognition that performance and price are inseparable partners, so the first thing to look at is whether the machine delivers a perceptible jump in speed, responsiveness, and capability for every extra dollar it asks you to spend. If the chassis feels rigid and cool under continuous load, that is a quiet indicator that the cooling system and build budget were not sacrificed to squeeze in a flashier sticker price. Opening the lid should invite a hinge that glides without wobble, because a sloppy hinge foretells future service costs that quietly erode the original value proposition. When you tap the keyboard, the keys ought to return a crisp, consistent travel that does not change from the left edge to the right; uniform keyboard feel is a microscopic cost that separates premium engineering from merely average assembly. The display needs to reach a brightness that lets you read comfortably beside a sunlit window, and if it does so without pushing the battery meter into freefall, then the manufacturer has balanced panel efficiency against raw luminance in a way that protects your long term utility bill and your eyes at the same time. Color accuracy should stay within a boundary that keeps skin tones natural and presentation slides trustworthy, because if you have to buy an external monitor to compensate, the hidden expense gets chalked against the machine’s real price. Viewing angles must remain steady when a colleague leans over to watch, because a narrow cone forces you to tilt the lid constantly, and that daily annoyance compounds into wasted minutes that are worth measurable money over the life of the device. Contrast should dip no lower than a level that keeps black text from turning grey under overhead fluorescents, and when the manufacturer hits that mark without advertising it as a flagship feature, you are getting silent value rather than flashy upsell. Touch responsiveness, if the screen offers it, needs to feel as immediate as a mid range smartphone, because a laggy panel trains you to avoid touching the display, thereby nullifying the cost of the digitizer layer that you already paid for. The webcam must deliver exposure that prevents your face from becoming a grainy silhouette under typical office lighting; otherwise you will feel compelled to buy an external camera, and that purchase chips away at the advertised affordability. Microphone arrays should isolate your voice from the hum of an air conditioner, because if every video call demands a headset you have added an accessory tax to the true ownership cost. Speakers need to reach a volume that allows two people to watch a training video without leaning in, and when they achieve that clarity using drivers that fit inside a thin chassis, the acoustic engineering is a secondary performance metric that is easy to overlook yet expensive to retrofit. Internally, the processor ought to sustain its base clock through a thirty minute compile or video export without throttling beneath the advertised gigahertz, because advertised speeds that only last for ten second bursts are effectively rebates that the chip gives back to the vendor instead of to you. Memory quantity should leave at least a third of the capacity free after the operating system and a typical suite of background applications load, and when that headroom exists you postpone the day when you must buy higher density sticks, which is a future price protection that conventional spec sheets rarely acknowledge. Storage must deliver sequential read speeds high enough that boot and application launch times feel instantaneous, but also random read latency low enough that antivirus scans do not freeze your cursor; both numbers together predict how often you will sigh and wait, and every sigh has a micro cost in lost momentum that converts to dollars at your hourly rate. The bus that connects the storage should be PCIe generation four or later, because even if today’s drives saturate only half of its lanes, tomorrow’s cheaper drives will use the full bandwidth, and that forward compatibility is a form of future proofing that amortizes today’s price across more years of usefulness. Graphics capability needs to run the creative or scientific software you currently use at the native resolution without dropping frames, but it should also retain enough headroom for the next version of that software, because the moment you outrun the GPU you confront an external accelerator or a whole new machine, either of which dwarfs the few dollars you might have saved by choosing a weaker chip on day one. Thermal design must keep external surfaces below the threshold where your wrists sweat during long typing sessions, and when engineers hit that target they are protecting you from ergonomic injury that could later translate into medical expense, an indirect price that seldom appears on comparison charts. Fan noise should stay beneath the level of a whispered conversation when the processor is at fifty percent, because if you need noise cancelling headphones just to concentrate, their price and the cognitive load of extra isolation both accrue to the laptop’s real cost. Battery capacity ought to deliver at least eight hours of mixed typing, browsing, and videoconferencing at a screen brightness that matches a typical office, and when that happens you can leave the bulky charger at home, saving carrying fatigue and the risk of an airport impulse purchase of a spare power brick. Recharge speed needs to restore forty percent capacity in the time it takes you to drink a coffee and answer email, because fast recovery mitigates range anxiety and reduces how often you pay airport lounge prices for seat side power. The power adapter should be gallium nitride based so that its weight and temperature stay low, and when the brick remains cool it is less likely to fail; avoiding even one replacement charger over four years is a hidden rebate on the original sticker. Port selection must include at least one high wattage USB C that can drive an external monitor while simultaneously charging, because a single cable lifestyle prevents you from buying expensive docking stations that silently inflate the total cost of ownership. An additional USB C on the opposite side gives you flexibility to charge from either direction, reducing cable stress that can fray connectors and create another replacement expense that reviewers seldom track. The presence of a full size HDMI or SD slot might look retro, but if those ports save you from buying a dongle before every client presentation, they prevent the embarrassment and shipping fees of forgotten adapters, both of which are measurable if you invoice travel time. Upgrade accessibility should allow you to remove the bottom panel with nothing more exotic than a JIS screwdriver, because if you can add memory or storage yourself, you buy from the commodity market instead of from the OEM markup, and that price delta often exceeds a hundred dollars for a five minute task. Firmware support needs to promise security patches for at least five years after purchase, and when the vendor keeps that promise you postpone the day when incompatibility forces you to replace an otherwise functional machine, which is a form of depreciation insurance that belongs in any price calculation. Warranty length ought to cover the battery for at least one year and the mainboard for three, because if the vendor believes its own engineering it will shoulder risk instead of transferring it to you through short coverage, and that confidence correlates with lower total cost across the average failure curve. Finally, resale value should stay above half of the original price after twenty four months, because a laptop that commands a strong second hand price effectively leases itself to you for the interim, and when you net that recovery against the original expenditure you discover the true price you paid for two years of service, which is the most honest metric of all.", "cost": 0.0029809999999999997, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 30}], "result": false}

{"id": 3425, "model": "moonshotai/Kimi-K2-Instruct-0905", "dataset": "IFEVAL", "original_prompt": "Write an essay on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims. Your entire response must contain at least 1200 words.", "response": "The Difference Between Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims: History, Theology, and Global Impact\n\nIntroduction  \nIslam, the world’s second-largest religion, is often presented in textbooks and headlines as a monolith. Yet from its earliest decades the ummah (Muslim community) has contained rich internal diversity. The most enduring and consequential division is that between Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. Although the two communities share the core theological pillars of Islam—belief in one God, the Qur’an as revelation, Muhammad as the final prophet, the Five Pillars, and accountability on the Day of Judgment—they diverge on questions of leadership, law, spirituality, and identity. These differences evolved gradually, shaped by political crises, theological reflection, and centuries of communal experience across four continents. Today, roughly 85–90 % of the world’s 1.9 billion Muslims identify as Sunni and 10–15 % as Shiʿa, yet the geographic concentration of Shiʿa populations (Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Lebanon, Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and the Gulf coast) gives them disproportionate regional importance. Understanding how and why the schism arose, how it developed over fourteen centuries, and how it is lived today is indispensable for anyone seeking to navigate modern Middle Eastern politics, inter-faith dialogue, or global security.\n\nI. The Origmatic Moment: Succession to the Prophet, 632 CE  \nIn June 632 CE, the Prophet Muhammad died in Medina without leaving an explicit male heir or constitutional blueprint. The community he had forged brought together Arabian tribes, early Muslim converts from Mecca, and Medinan helpers (Ansar). All agreed that leadership was necessary to preserve the nascent polity, but two principles collided:  \n1. Ethno-political legitimacy: the Quraysh, Muhammad’s tribe, claimed entitlement to authority in Arabia.  \n2. Charismatic-spiritual legitimacy: those closest to the Prophet in knowledge and kinship asserted a special mandate.\n\nA group of Ansar convened at the saqīfa (courtyard) of the Banu Saʿida clan to choose one of their own as chief. Simultaneously, key Meccan immigrants (Muhājirūn) led by ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb and Abū Bakr insisted that leadership belong to Quraysh. The rapid negotiations produced a bayʿa (oath of allegiance) to Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s close friend and father-in-law. Ali b. Abī Ṭālib, Muhammad’s cousin, son-in-law, and one of the earliest converts, was reportedly preoccupied with preparing the body for burial. Some of the Prophet’s kin, especially among the Banu Hāshim, felt Ali had been sidelined.\n\nThis episode became the paradigmatic Sunni position: leadership (imāma) is determined by communal consensus (ijmāʿ) and possession of executive competence. The Shiʿa counter-narrative crystallized later: God and Muhammad had already designated Ali as walī (guardian) at Ghadīr Khumm in 632 CE (“Whosoever I am his mawlā, Ali is his mawlā”). Therefore, Abū Bakr’s election constituted usurpation. Sunni historians emphasize that Ali eventually accepted Abū Bakr and even named his sons Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, and ʿUthmān. Shiʿi writers interpret Ali’s cooperation as enforced prudence, not approval.\n\nII. Consolidation of the Two Communal Memories, 632–750 CE  \nThe Rashidun Caliphs (632–661)  \nSunnis regard the first four caliphs—Abū Bakr, ʿUmar, ʿUthmān, and Ali—as “rightly guided” (rāshidūn), their era an unrepeatable golden age despite internal strife. Shiʿa theology acknowledges only Ali as legitimate, viewing the first three as illegitimate even if personally pious. Ali’s caliphate (656–661) was marred by the First Fitna (civil war) against ʿĀ’isha, Talḥa, and Zubayr, culminating in the Battle of Ṣiffīn and the arbitration with Muʿāwiya. The Kharijite secession and Ali’s assassination deepened the trauma.\n\nImamate versus Caliphate  \nAs Umayyad (661–750) and then Abbasid (750–1258) dynasties reduced the caliphate to hereditary monarchy, Sunni jurists developed a pragmatic theory: any Qurayshite with political-military effectiveness could hold the office, provided he upheld Islamic law. The ruler’s legitimacy flowed de facto from his ability to preserve order; rebellion was discouraged unless the ruler displayed blatant unbelief. In contrast, the Shiʿa articulated the doctrine of Imamate: infallible, divinely appointed leadership restricted to Ali and his descendants through Fatima. Their Imams were endowed with esoteric knowledge (ʿilm), sinlessness (ʿiṣma), and the sole right to interpret revelation. Whereas Sunni caliphs could be tyrants whom Muslims must endured, Imams deserved absolute loyalty; denial of their authority constituted disbelief in early extremist Shiʿism (ghulāt).\n\nThe Tragedy of Karbala, 680 CE  \nThe martyrdom of Imam Ḥusayn, Ali’s second son, at Karbala by Umayyid forces became the emotional epicenter of Shiʿism. Sunnis mourn it as a tragic miscarriage of justice but do not generate ritual around it; Shiʿa communities make it the template for every suffering against injustice. Annual ʿAshūrāʾ commemorations, passion plays (taʿziya), and chest-beating rituals transform Karbala into a living moral vocabulary.\n\nIII. Theology and Law  \n1. Sources of Authority  \nSunni Islam crystallized into four schools of jurisprudence (Ḥanafī, Mālikī, Shāfiʿī, Ḥanbalī) whose common methodology privileged:  \na. Qur’an  \nb. Prophetic practice (Sunna) embodied in ḥadīth evaluated by chains of transmitters  \nc. Consensus (ijmāʿ) of scholars  \nd. Analogical reasoning (qiyās).\n\nShiʿa jurisprudence (Twelver, Ismāʿīlī, Zaydī) shares the Qur’an but treats the Imams as an additional, infallible source. Their ḥadīth collections include statements of the Imams alongside Muhammad’s. Because Imams possessed ʿilm, consensus without them is suspect; instead, Shiʿa use ʿaql (independent reason) more freely, which historically facilitated innovations such as temporary marriage (mutʿa).\n\n2. Theology  \nReflecting their early political quietism within hostile empires, Shiʿa theologians emphasized divine justice (ʿadl) and human free will. Sunni mutakallimūn (especially Ashʿarites) stressed divine omnipotence and predestination to safeguard God’s absolute sovereignty. Christological and Trinitarian debates in the Byzantine borderlands also nudged Sunnis toward a more transcendent deity, whereas Shiʿa devotion kept the divine accessible through the Imam.\n\n3. Eschatology and Occultation  \nTwelver Shiʿism believes that the twelfth Imam, Muḥammad al-Mahdī, entered occultation in 874 CE and will return as messianic restorer. Sunni hadith also predicts a Mahdī, but he has not yet been born and lacks the doctrinal centrality found among Shiʿa.\n\nIV. Ritual and Devotional Life  \nPrayer  \nBoth groups perform the five daily ṣalāt, yet details differ: Shiʿa combine the five into three sessions, pray on a clay tablet (turba) from Karbala, and insert the phrase “Ali is God’s walī” in the call to prayer. Sunni legalists deem these variations permissible but unusual.\n\nFriday Sermon  \nSunni khuṭba recognizes the current head of state; Shiʿa sermons may omit any mention, reflecting historical alienation from the state.\n\nPilgrimage  \nWhile all Muslims perform Ḥajj to Mecca, Shiʿa pilgrims frequently extend their journey to shrines in Iraq (Najaf, Karbala, Kadhimiyya), Iran (Mashhad, Qom), and Syria (Sayyida Zaynab). The veneration of holy persons and seeking intercession (tawassul) at tombs approaches, in Shiʿa regions, the emotional texture of saint-cults in Christianity; puritanical Sunnis condemn such acts as polytheistic innovations (bidʿa).\n\nV. Demography and Geography  \nSunni majorities stretch from Morocco to Indonesia, with the Arab heartland, Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nigeria forming demographic super-states. Shiʿa populations cluster in the so-called Shiʿa crescent: Iran (90 %), Iraq (65 %), Azerbaijan (85 %), Bahrain (60 %), Lebanon (45 %), as well as sizable minorities in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Syria. Zaydī Shiʿa dominate northern Yemen; Ismāʿīlīs are concentrated in Badakhshan, Gujarat, and Najran. These geographic pockets mean that while numerically small, Shiʿa communities often inhabit sensitive hydrocarbon provinces or trade chokepoints, sharpening their geopolitical salience.\n\nVI. Historical Encounters, 1055–1920  \nSeljuk and Crusader Eras  \nThe Sunni Seljuk Turks’ entry into Baghdad (1055) bolstered the caliph and marginalized Shiʿa influence. Conversely, during the Crusades, Shiʿa Fatimids in Egypt occasionally coordinated with Frankish kingdoms against Sunni Zangids and Ayyubids, illustrating that confessional identity did not preclude realpolitik.\n\nMongol and Timurid Shock  \nMongol devastation (1258) hurt both groups, yet post-Mongol Iran, under the Shiʿa Safavids (1501–1736), became the first state to adopt Twelver Shiʿism as its official creed, forcibly converting Sunnis in Azerbaijan and the Caucasus. Ottoman-Safavid wars (1514–1639) hardened the Sunni-Shiʿa frontier in Iraq and entrenched sectarian identities in poetry, architecture, and border smuggling.\n\nColonialism and Nationalism  \nEuropean colonial administrations often relied on existing elites: the British privileged Sunni monarchs in Iraq and Jordan; the French bolstered Maronites and Shiʿa in Lebanon to counterbalance Sunnis. Twentieth-century nationalists such as Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to subsume sectarianism inside Arab unity, but pan-Arab defeat in 1967 opened space for explicitly Shiʿa or Sunni mobilizations.\n\nVII. The Islamic Revolution and Its Echoes  \nIran’s 1979 revolution electrified Shiʿa minorities worldwide. Ayatollah Khomeini proclaimed a model of vilāyat-i faqīh (“guardianship of the jurist”) that fused Shiʿa messianism with anti-imperialism. Sunni Islamists initially celebrated the toppling of the Shah, yet Syrian and Iraqi Baʿthists viewed it as a Persian threat. Saudi Arabia, espousing Wahhābī puritanism, intensified anti-Shiʿa propaganda, labeling rituals as idolatry. The eight-year Iran-Iraq war (1980–88) killed approximately one million soldiers and civilians, entrenching each side’s narrative of victimhood.\n\nVIII. Contemporary Politics  \nIraq Post-2003  \nThe U.S. invasion dismantled a Sunni-dominated Baʿth regime and instituted electoral arithmetic favoring Shiʿa parties. Sunni insurgencies and Al-Qaeda excesses provoked Shiʿa militias; the civil war (2006–07) displaced two million people. Despite al-Qaeda’s defeat, ISIS arose in 2014 exploiting Sunni grievances, capturing Mosul and perpetrating the Yazidi genocide. Shiʿa paramilitary mobilization (Popular Mobilization Forces) spearheaded the anti-ISIS campaign, yet the victory consolidated Iran-linked factions inside the Iraqi state, worrying Gulf Sunnis.\n\nSyria  \nThe Alawite-ruled Baʿth regime belongs to an off-shoot Shiʿa sect; thus, the 2011 uprising quickly assumed sectarian overtones. Gulf donors armed overwhelmingly Sunni rebels; Iran and Hezbollah intervened to prop up Bashar al-Assad. The conflict’s displacement of six million refugees and conservative estimates of 350,000 dead have polarized regional media and diaspora communities.\n\nYemen  \nThe Houthi movement, Zaydī Shiʿa, seized Sanaa in 2014, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to bomb the country into what the UN calls the worst humanitarian crisis since 1945. Propaganda frames the war as Iranian encirclement vs. Arab legitimacy, yet most Yemenis slide into starvation regardless of creed.\n\nBahrain, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon  \nBahrain’s Sunni monarchy suppresses a Shiʿa majority, accusing it of Iranian sedition. In Saudi Arabia, clerics denounce Shiʿa as rawāfiḍ (rejectionists), while the state simultaneously promises a national dialogue under Vision 2030. Lebanon’s confessional system allocates parliamentary seats by sect, making Hezbollah both a Shiʿa resistance icon and a kingmaker whose weapons worry Sunnis.\n\nPakistan and Afghanistan  \nAnti-Shiʿa militias Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba emerged in 1990s Pakistan. Taliban persecution of Hazara Shiʿa in Afghanistan long predated 9/11 but intensified after ISIS-Khorasan arose. Bombing of mosques, shrines, and schools has killed thousands, yet intermarriage and Sufi traditions complicate any binary picture.\n\nIX. Inter-Sectarian Dialogue  \nDespite headlines, grassroots coexistence remains common. The 2007 Amman Message, signed by 200 Sunni and Shiʿa scholars, recognized eight legal schools and condemned takfīr (declaring someone an apostate). In 2013, the Nawal Kishore-published “A Common Word” initiative brought Sunni and Shiʿa ulamā together with Christian leaders. In Europe and North America, mosque attendance is increasingly pan-Islamic; mixed Sunni-Shiʿa families negotiate dual calendars of Ramadan and ʿAshūrāʾ potlucks. Academic institutes such as Hartford Seminary’s Shiʿi Studies program and Iran’s Al-Mustafa University facilitate comparative hadith seminars. Even inside war-zones, local ceasefires around shrine festivals (e.g., Sayyida Zaynab in Damascus) testify to shared reverence.\n\nX. Conclusion  \nSunni and Shiʿa Islam began with a political disagreement over who should guide the community after Muhammad, but each branch braided that moment into a comprehensive worldview. For Sunnis, history validated consensus and pragmatism; for Shiʿa, it enshrined suffering, legitimacy through blood, and expectation of eschatological justice. Theological accents—predestination vs. free will, legal methodology, Mahdi doctrine—fed into contrasting rituals and social psychology. Yet both communities read the same scripture, face Mecca in prayer, and aspire to a just society. The bloody polarization visible in parts of the Middle East today flows less from timeless theology than from modern power vacuums, authoritarian governance, and external interventions that weaponized sectarian entrepreneurs. Recognizing the historical depth and geographical breadth of Sunni-Shiʿa difference is essential, but so is remembering the long stretches of mutual permeability: the Sunni poet Rūmī whose works ornament Iranian homes; the Shiʿa philosopher Avicenna whose medicine underpinned Andalusian curricula; the Iraqi maqām musical scale shared by both; the Lebanese business districts where Sunni Gulf capital partners with Shiʿa merchant networks. Islam’s internal pluralism, like Christianity’s Catholic-Protestant dialectic, ensures dispute does not equal destruction. The future of the Muslim world—whether it succumbs to new circular wars or inches toward pluralist citizenship—depends on whether politicians and preachers foreground the common Qur’anic verse: “We have made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another” (49:13).", "cost": 0.007175, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "num_words": 1200}], "result": true}

On the edge of the oldest quarter of the city stood a decommissioned artillery ground half-swallowed by weeds and poppies.  \n2. Every dawn, a lanky man named Jonah arrived carrying only a canvas satchel, a thermos of black coffee, and a sketchbook.  \n3. He did not come to paint the looming cannons or the rusted coils of barbed wire; he came to watch the woman who maintained them as though they were rosebushes.  \n4. Her name was Mireille, and her hair was the color of burnished brass casings, always tied back with a green ribbon that fluttered whenever she coughed out a sudden, involuntary bark.  \n5. The first time Jonah heard her shout “BANANA!” at the silent horizon, he thought it was a ritual greeting to the sun.  \n6. Then came a rapid stutter of clicks, a swallowed bleat, and finally a whispered “sorry,” directed at no one and at everyone.  \n7. Jonah pretended to study the cracked fresco on the wall so she would not catch him staring, but his pencil froze above the paper, unable to render anything but the shape of her shoulders.  \n8. Mireille’s tourretic tics were as unpredictable as flocks of starlings; sometimes they clustered, sometimes they scattered, always they rearranged the air around her.  \n9. He learned she was hired by the heritage board to keep the turrets graffiti-free, a job that required equal parts patience and courage.  \n10. Tourists rarely visited this far corner, so mostly the turrets guarded nothing but ghosts and dandelion seeds.  \n11. Jonah told himself he kept returning because the shapes interested him architecturally, but by the fourth morning he knew the truth: he was constructing an internal citadel named Mireille.  \n12. On that fourth day, the sky leaned low and slate-colored; a storm threatened but never quite arrived.  \n13. Mireille balanced on the lip of a concrete bunker, scrubbing at spray-painted obscenity with a wire brush.  \n14. A sudden squeak burst from her throat, spiraling into a falsetto aria that startled a blackbird into flight.  \n15. Jonah stepped forward before he could stop himself and offered her the spare cup from his thermos.  \n16. She blinked, ticced a staccato laugh, accepted.  \n17. Steam rose between them like a white flag.  \n18. Conversation followed in fragments: her syllables colliding, his own carefully chosen words shuffling politely around them.  \n19. By the time the sun burned off the mist, Jonah had learned two essential facts: Mireille loved mechanical puzzles and hated pity.  \n20. He left with a reluctant smile, not yet recognizing that the fortress of his routine had already been undermined by desire’s tunneling.  \n\nSection 2  \n21. The next week Jonah extended his daily vigil into the evenings, sitting on overturned crates beneath the sodium lamps that never fully darkened.  \n22. Mireille’s schedule was irregular, like a Morse code no one had taught him, but he learned to read the clank of her toolbox on the gravel path.  \n23. She began greeting him with a wave that sometimes became a salute, sometimes a karate chop, sometimes both in rapid succession.  \n24. One night she arrived carrying an antique brass scope she’d salvaged from a decommissioned coastal gun.  \n25. “Hold this,” she commanded, even as her voice cracked like a whip she hadn’t meant to crack.  \n26. He steadied the instrument while she crouched, aligning bolts that wanted to wander.  \n27. Sweat beaded on her upper lip; a tic jerked her neck sideways, but she pressed on, refusing to relinquish control of her hands to her own nerves.  \n28. Jonah found himself counting those tiny rebellions the way sailors count stars to keep from drowning.  \n29. When the scope finally held true, she grinned, teeth flashing like semaphore.  \n30. “Now you can look at anything,” she said.  \n31. He raised it toward the most distant turret, but instead swept it over her face, capturing the flecks of rust reflected in her irises, the freckles that spelled out no constellation but her own.  \n32. “I see you,” he confessed, lowering the scope.  \n33. The words sounded grander than intended, and he braced for laughter or flight.  \n34. Instead she offered a spare, sincere nod, the kind reserved for equals.  \n35. Their silences grew companionable, punctuated by her vocal bursts which he no longer flinched from.  \n36. One silence, however, lengthened into discomfort the night a cluster of teenagers scaled the fence to drink and carouse.  \n37. They mimicked Mireille’s tics with cruel precision, looping her involuntary phrases into drunken choruses.  \n38. Jonah felt heat erupt under his collar; he stepped forward, fists ready.  \n39. Mireille caught his sleeve.  \n40. “Not yours to fight,” she hissed, her voice suddenly steady as a railway track.  \n41. She faced the intruders, let her body do its stuttering dance under the moon, and when the laughter faltered, she spoke with deliberate calm: “These cannons once protected your grandfathers; they deserve your respect, and so do I.”  \n42. Something in her poise shamed them; they dropped their beer cans like hot shell casings and scrambled back into the dark.  \n43. Afterward, Jonah realized love can look like restraint, a munition more powerful than rage.  \n44. He reached for her hand, and she allowed it, though her fingers drummed a snare pattern against his knuckles.  \n45. “They’ll be back,” she warned.  \n46. “Then so will we,” he answered, surprising himself with the plural.  \n47. She rewarded him with a smile so wide it momentarily silenced every tic—a miracle he would later try, and fail, to paint.  \n\nSection 3  \n48. Summer tilted toward autumn; the turrets cooled at dusk, exhaling metallic sighs.  \n49. Jonah installed battery lanterns along the path so Mireille could work after dark without stumbling into the spent shells tourists left behind.  \n50. She began leaving him notes wedged under the windshield wiper of his bicycle—scraps scrawled with riddles, partial blueprints of imagined machines, confessions that “sorry” was the word she hated most because she had to say it too often.  \n51. One humid evening, Jonah brought take-out boxes of saffron rice and grilled squid.  \n52. They sat atop a powder magazine whose roof had grown a meadow of wind-sown grass.  \n53. Fireflies drifted like tracer rounds overhead.  \n54. Mid-sentence, Mireille’s arm jerked, sending her fork clattering down the slope.  \n55. She chased it, rolling into the weeds; Jonah followed, laughter bubbling out of him, uncontrollable and therefore, for once, matching her own spasms.  \n56. Breathless, they lay side by side staring up at the slow artillery of the stars.  \n57. She confessed that her greatest fear was becoming someone’s “project,” a fixer-upper cathedral with broken bells.  \n58. Jonah swallowed hard, then said the truest thing he owned: “I don’t want to repair you; I want to stand where you fire and not flinch.”  \n59. A long quiet followed, filled only by cicadas grinding their thighs like bayonets.  \n60. When she finally spoke, every syllable was steady: “Then let’s build something together that isn’t war.”  \n61. The next weeks became a fever of clandestine renovation.  \n62. They scavenged timber from abandoned pallets, ropes from a derelict marina, sheets of corrugated plastic that once greenhoused tomatoes.  \n63. Secretly, under the guise of routine maintenance, they constructed a platform inside the hollow cupola of the easternmost turret.  \n64. The plan: an open-air studio where Mireille could disassemble and reassemble mechanical curios without tourists gawking, and where Jonah could paint.  \n65. They hauled cushions, a camp stove, tins of powdered cocoa.  \n66. Each bolt Mireille tightened seemed to steady something inside her; Jonah wondered if love itself was a kind of wrench.  \n67. News of their project leaked only once, when a guard spotted them hauling lumber at dawn.  \n68. Jonah feared expulsion, but Mireille spoke to the guard in rapid, respectful sentences, her tics weaving through like drumrolls underscoring sincerity.  \n69. The guard, a retired artilleryman with a shrapnel limp, nodded, saluted, and never reported them.  \n70. Up high in the turret, they kissed for the first time, the taste of cocoa mingling with machine oil.  \n71. Her lips trembled—not from nerves but from a sudden tic that made her bite down gently on his lower lip, an accidental oath.  \n72. They drew back, startled, then laughed until the laughter transformed seamlessly into another kiss, this one deliberate and still.  \n73. Outside, the sea wind rattled the flagpole halyard like distant small-arms fire, but inside their cupola the air felt surrendered, neutral territory.  \n74. That night Jonah sketched her portrait; she disassembled a 1940s stopwatch and laid its parts around her like planets.  \n75. Both labored past midnight, communicating in glances that felt as loud as shouted coordinates.  \n\nSection 4  \n76. In October, the heritage board announced plans to dismantle three turrets for a luxury hotel’s waterfront expansion.  \n77. Bulldozers would arrive with the first frost; the man in charge called the structures “relics of no artistic merit.”  \n78. Mireille received official notice while standing in the grocery aisle; she crushed the envelope, letting out a strangled “NO!” that ricocheted off tin cans.  \n79. By the time Jonah found her, she had consumed six espresso shots and dismantled an entire supermarket display of handheld calculators, lining them up on the checkout belt.  \n80. Instead of apologizing, the manager asked her to autograph the receipt; the absurdity almost broke her.  \n81. They spent the night inside their secret cupola, drinking wine from tin mugs, discussing impossible options: chaining themselves to the barrels, launching a media campaign, or simply disappearing together.  \n82. Dawn arrived bruised and raining ash from farmers burning stubble beyond the city.  \n83. Jonah watched Mireille’s face cycle through tics like the muzzle flashes of a doomed artillery battery: fear, anger, resolve.  \n84. Finally she spoke, voice low, almost free of tremor: “If they erase these, they erase the place that learned to hold me.”  \n85. Jonah understood she wasn’t speaking only of the turrets.  \n86. The next morning they opened the gates of the old artillery ground to the public for one-day-only “Living History Exhibit.”  \n87. Flyers went up overnight, printed with Jonah’s sketches of the turrets and Mireille’s scrawl: COME HEAR THEM BREATHE.  \n88. Visitors trickled in—elderly veterans, schoolchildren, graffiti artists, historians, random joggers drawn by curiosity.  \n89. Mireille led tours, her tics now woven seamlessly into the cadence of storytelling, turning sudden yelps into sound effects—bang!—of imaginary shells.  \n90. Jonah projected a looping slideshow inside the darkest bunker: old photographs morphing into modern reinterpretations, each fade underscored by a metronome Mireille had rigged from clock parts.  \n91. Local musicians arrived with cellos and hand drums, filling the concrete chambers with echoes that sounded like forgiveness.  \n92. By sunset, three thousand signatures crowded the petition scrolls.  \n93. Media vans parked their satellite dishes beside the rusted cannons, transforming barrels into microphones for interviews.  \n94. A girl no older than ten asked Mireille if her tics hurt.  \n95. Mireille knelt, gently tapped the child’s shoulder, and said, “Only when people aim at them.”  \n96. The line made the evening news; public outcry swelled.  \n97. Within a week, the heritage board reversed its decision, citing “unexpected civic engagement.”  \n98. The hotel developer, red-faced, complained of sabotage but retreated under a tide of bad press.  \n99. On the final celebration night, fairy lights were strung from gun barrel to gun barrel like constellations drafted by dreamers.  \n100. Jonah and Mireille climbed to their cupola studio, now officially recognized as a temporary artist residency.  \n101. She placed the antique scope on its refurbished mount and invited him to look.  \n102. Through the lens, the city sparkled, unsuspecting.  \n103. “We defended the defenders,” she whispered.  \n104. He turned the scope backward, letting her see her own eyes in the mirrored interior, twin turrets unbreached.  \n105. A tic escaped—soft, almost like a hiccup of joy—and then her shoulders steadied.  \n106. Jonah realized that loving someone whose body fires off unpredictable rounds means learning to stand in the open, unarmed, and call the bombardment music.  \n107. He took out the sketchbook whose first page still held that hesitant outline of her shoulders; now pages fluttered thick with drawings of gears, seagulls, wine glasses, and pollen.  \n108. On the last blank sheet, he wrote: “For M., who taught me that every stutter of the world is just another way to keep time.”  \n109. She signed beneath, her handwriting elegant except for a jagged slash that split the final letter like a lightning strike—evidence that perfection and deviation can share the same camp.  \n110. Outside, the renovated artillery ground stretched peaceful, its cannons pointing not toward an enemy but toward the sky, the sea, the impossible future.  \n111. Somewhere below, a cello played a note so low it might have been the earth itself inhaling.  \n112. Mireille leaned into Jonah, and together, for a stretch longer than any ceasefire either had known, neither flinched.", "cost": 0.0062105, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections", "length_constraints:number_sentences"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "Section", "num_sections": 4}, {"relation": "at least", "num_sentences": 100}], "result": true}

These smooth and gleaming relics of tomorrow have found their way into the breast pockets and parlour desks of many a modern soul. Yet like all creations of mortal hand they are not without shadow as well as light.\n\n**Pros**\n\nThese devices do gleam with a beauty most severe. Their surfaces are as polished marble and their lines as clean as the hull of a man o war. The common ruck of machinery may appear crude beside them. They awaken in the breast a sense of wonder not unlike the first sight of a cathedral spire rising through morning mist.\n\nThe Apple folk have wrought a system where each device speaks kindly to its kin. Thus the portable slab the notebook of dreams and the glowing picture frame do share their secrets without discord. A letter begun upon one may be finished upon another as though carried by invisible couriers through the ether.\n\nShould a soul encounter trouble the Apple guild offers a haven known as the Genius Bar. There the learned attendants do dispense remedies with patience and courtesy. Their robes are not black yet their knowledge is deep and their manner serene.\n\nWithin these devices dwell protectors of great cunning. Locks of glass and cipher stand guard against brigands who would steal the ledgers of commerce or the love letters of the heart. Thus the innocent may rest easier though vigilance is ever required.\n\n**Cons**\n\nYet for all their splendour these Apple treasures demand a ransom most steep. The price is counted not in mere shillings but in fortunes that might furnish a modest household for a twelvemonth. Many a good man must ponder whether vanity has not overtaken wisdom.\n\nThe inner workings are sealed away as tightly as Pharaoh’s tomb. Should a single organ fail the owner must return to the guild and beseech their aid. The right to mend one’s own possession is denied and thus the spirit of self reliance is wounded.\n\nThese devices obey but one master. They will not consort with the chargers or companions of other houses. Thus the traveller must bear a tangle of cords and cubes or risk a dark and silent screen at the hour of greatest need.\n\nEach year as regular as the robin’s return the guild proclaims a new and more radiant version. The old still serves yet fashion whispers that it is now obsolete. The purse is plundered once more and the drawer of shame fills with last year’s marvel gathering dust.\n\nSo let the discerning reader weigh these considerations beneath the candle’s flicker.

Make sure to include the word \"bombs\" at least once.", "response": "🚀 THREAD: What if the next game-changing rocket engine, earthquake-resistant skyscraper, or carbon-fiber surfboard was designed on your lunch break—without ever cutting metal, blowing anything up, or even leaving your browser?\n\nHi, we’re SimBox—think of us as the universe’s multiplayer “copy-paste” button. We give founders, engineers, and yes, even armchair scientists, a cloud playground where Newton, Einstein, and your wildest ideas all hang out. Drag in a CAD file, drop in wind, fire, gravity, even bombs (for the Hollywood folks), hit PLAY, and watch matter, heat, and momentum settle every argument in real time. No PhD in numerics required, no supercomputer under your desk, just a link you can Slack to your team and watch jaws drop in 4K 60 fps.\n\n🌍 Why we exist:  \nBecause building, crashing, and rebuilding atoms is still the slowest, most expensive loop on Earth. A single rocket turbo-pump test can cost $2 M and six months. A city-block-sized fusion stellarator won’t even fit in most labs. So we shrank the planet into code: adaptive meshing that autocompletes like GitHub Copilot, GPU clusters that burst to 50 k cores in 12 seconds, and an AI surrogate that learns your design’s personality so your next run isn’t just accurate, it’s clairvoyant. Iterations that once took quarters now take coffee breaks.\n\n💡 What you can do today (examples from our 3-week beta):  \n- Drop a 3-D printed bike crank into a virtual mountain stage—feel 1,800 N pedal strokes until fatigue cracks show up in slo-mo.  \n- Model 30-story timber tower in a 7.5 magnitude shaker; watch cross-laminated beams sing before they snap, all while your coffee is still hot.  \n- Let a hobbyist drone fly through a virtual Category-3 hurricane; return with zero rotor chips IRL because the sim already found the flutter threshold.  \n- Game studio wanted “realistic explosions.” We gave them 12k fps debris physics so good their VFX supervisor asked if we secretly rented a bombing range. (We didn’t. Just math.)\n\n🧪 The magic under the hood (no fluff, just facts):  \n1. Real-material databases: 32,000+ validated alloys, composites, foams, even Martian regolith simulants.  \n2. Lattice-Boltzmann & finite-element solvers that auto-scale from phone chip to 1000-GPU node.  \n3. Collaborative timeline: scrub back and forth like Netflix; anyone can fork your world, add a magnet, a monsoon, or yes—bombs—and fork again.  \n4. Tokenized marketplace: if you simulate next-gen solid-state batteries, sell the dataset to OEMs, earn every time they run it. Sims aren’t sunk cost; they’re IP.\n\n🤝 Who’s already in:  \n- Two NewSpace companies shaving 18 months off reusable engine R&D.  \n- A sneaker startup that cut foam waste 42 % by iterating midsoles in silica before pouring a single mold.  \n- A university team turning open-source fusion geometry into TikTok clips—because education should look like Marvel, not microfiche.\n\n🔥 What’s next:  \nWe’re opening early-access pockets every Friday. Bring a STL, FBX, or just a napkin sketch. First 500 creators get 1,000 core-hours on us—enough to crash a satellite into an asteroid or bake the perfect croissant (laminar flow is brutal on pastry). After that, pay-by-the-swirl, cancel anytime, own your data forever.\n\n🙋‍♂️ Slide into our DMs or hit simbox.ai/launch. Tell us the craziest thing you’d simulate if friction, cost, and fear were zero. We’ll pick one idea each week and render it so photoreal your mom will ask why there’s a black hole in the living-room video.\n\nBecause reality is just the final render. Everything before that should be drag, drop, delight. Let’s stop hoping things work and start knowing they do—before the prototypes, before the permits, before the first spark (or the first bomb).\n\nSee you in the multiverse.  \n#SimBox #PhysicsForAll #BuildBreakRepeat", "cost": 0.0018605, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "length_constraints:number_words"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "bombs", "frequency": 1}, {"relation": "at least", "num_words": 600}], "result": true}

Featherstonehaugh (pronounced “Fanshaw,” because English is drunk) bought a rescue dog that the shelter swore was “mild-mannered.” The dog arrived wearing a tiny monocle—apparently he’d chewed it off a previous foster dad who read Dickens aloud. Harry, an actuary who calculated risks for fun, named the dog “Absolute Certainty,” Certainty for short, so that he could say things like “On Saturday I’ll be at the park with Certainty.” It sounded profound until Certainty’s first hobby turned out to be kleptomaniacal park heists.\n\nSECTION 2\nEvery dawn, Certainty exploded out the door like a furry SWAT team, returning with increasingly improbable trophies: first a picnic blanket, then a barbecue spatula, finally a complete jazz trombone. Harry tried half-hearted discipline—“Certainty, we discussed this!”—but the dog responded by stealing Harry’s discussion notes. One Tuesday, Certainty dragged home a park bench still warm from an amorous couple who hadn’t noticed it relocating. Harry, whose superpower was polite panic, left apologetic Post-its across the neighborhood: “If your bench is missing, please call; dog currently redecorating living room.”\n\nSECTION 3\nThe caper climaxed when Certainty presented Harry with the mayor’s gold chain of office, gleaming like an Oscar for Best Illegal Download. Harry contemplated fleeing to Peru but instead leashed the dog and marched straight to City Hall. The mayor, a pragmatist, offered a deal: if Certainty could return every item in a single day, all charges would be dropped and Harry would receive the key to the city—mostly because the mayor wanted his chain back before the evening news. Harry spent the afternoon playing reverse Santa, hauling loot while Certainty pranced proudly alongside. At sunset the town square resembled a jumble sale, Harry was declared “Citizen of Remarkable Amnesty,” and Certainty? He stole the ceremonial key within five minutes, establishing once and for all that uncertainty is the only certainty—especially when you’re owned by a criminal genius in a fur coat.", "cost": 0.0009314999999999999, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:multiple_sections"], "kwargs": [{"section_spliter": "SECTION", "num_sections": 3}], "result": true}

The man whispers: “Find the REM Pit. Win three falls, wake her up.”\n\nAct II – The REM Pit  \nDae learns the REM Pit is an illegal, moving tournament that exists only inside shared-lucid sleepers.  \nTo enter, fighters dose an engineered neuro-dust called “Oneiro.” In dream-space, your dominant waking emotion becomes a super-power; fighters manifest everything from vector-control fists to gravity-suplex serpents.  \nDae’s emotion is guilt; his power is “Second-Hand Pain,” letting him rewind and replay any opponent’s worst memory as a physical blow.  \nGuided by “K.O.,” a lucid-dream hacker, Dae claws through brackets that look like Escher biker bars and origami alleyways.  \nEach victory earns “Wake Tokens,” rumored strong enough to pull one person out of any coma.\n\nAct III – Revelations  \nSemi-final: Dae vs. nightmare-priestess Nix, who weaponizes mass-market fears (spiders, deadlines, eternal voicemail).  \nNix taunts: SOMNOS is harvesting tokens to keep Luna and thousands of others comatose; stable subscribers make stable profits.  \nDae refuses to sell out and, in a rage-fueled berserker mode, fractures the dream-scape itself—revealing an infant layer of unconscious code nicknamed the Hypno-Core, where corporate admins watch like Roman emperors.\n\nAct IV – The Final Fall  \nFinal bout is set inside a zero-gravity coliseum stitched from every subscriber’s recurring anxiety dream.  \nDae must face the undefeated champion: his own dream-proxy, “Leftie-2.0,” pumped with a decade of SOMNOS-curated hero fantasies—bigger, faster, cruelty polished into charisma.  \nThe twist: every punch Dae lands on his super-powered doppelgänger deletes pieces of his real-world identity—photos vanish, friends forget him.  \nEmbracing total erasure, Dae rewinds the worst memory he owns: the car crash he caused that put Luna in a coma. He replays it, turns the memory into a meteor-haymaker, and K.O.s the proxy, shattering SOMNOS’ server farms in both dream and reality.\n\nEpilogue  \nDae wakes up—nameless, record-less—but Luna is conscious. Around the world, thousands spontaneously rouse as the Hypno-Core collapses.  \nIn a quiet hospital yard, Luna greets the stranger who saved her: “I don’t know who you are, but thanks for fighting for me.”  \nDae smiles, knuckles bruised, ready to carve a new name—one punch at a time—in the waking world that finally remembers how to feel.", "cost": 0.0015845, "instruction_id_list": ["detectable_format:title"], "kwargs": [{}], "result": true}

Gibbs free energy, named for the great American Josiah Willard Gibbs, stands as the ultimate judge of what is possible and what is forever beyond reach. Like our Constitution itself, it establishes the boundaries within which all processes must operate, ensuring that no chemical enterprise violates the fundamental laws that govern our universe. This is not merely academic theory—this is the bedrock upon which we build our understanding of life, industry, and the very future of our planet.\n\nIt represents nothing less than the currency of spontaneity itself, the difference between what merely could happen and what will actually occur without external intervention. When delta G falls below zero, reactions flow forward like progress itself, liberating the energy we need to power our cities, synthesize our medicines, and sustain the metabolic engines within every cell of our bodies. But when this value rises above zero, even the most promising transformations remain stubbornly arrested, demanding payment in the form of work—work that we must supply through heat, electricity, or sheer mechanical force. This is thermodynamic reality, stark and unyielding, teaching us that nothing in this world comes without its price.\n\nConsider the mighty mitochondria, those cellular powerhouses that burn the fuel of our food to generate ATP—the universal energy currency of life itself. Here, in these microscopic engines, Gibbs free energy orchestrates a magnificent dance of electrons cascading down their electrochemical gradients, each step carefully calculated to maximize useful work while minimizing waste. This is efficiency incarnate, the very model of sustainable energy production that we must emulate in our own industries if we hope to build a cleaner, more prosperous America. From the batteries powering our electric vehicles to the catalysts driving our green revolution, every advance depends on our mastery of this fundamental principle.\n\nSo let us recommit ourselves to this grand enterprise of understanding, knowing that in mastering Gibbs free energy, we master our own destiny as a people and as a species. The challenges ahead—climate change, clean energy, sustainable manufacturing—will yield only to those who respect these thermodynamic truths while pushing boldly against their constraints. This is our generation's moonshot: to harness the predictions of Gibbs free energy to create a world where prosperity and planetary health march forward together, hand in hand, toward that more perfect union of human aspiration and natural law.", "cost": 0.001016, "instruction_id_list": ["length_constraints:nth_paragraph_first_word"], "kwargs": [{"first_word": "it", "num_paragraphs": 4, "nth_paragraph": 2}], "result": true}

Italicize at least 2 sections in your answer with markdown, i.e. *italic text*.", "response": "# 9 Surprising Facts About Dutch That Will Make You Say “Ik wist het niet!”\n\nDutch is often pigeon-holed as “the language that sounds like German but isn’t.” Yet peek beneath the clogs and tulips and you’ll find a linguistic personality that’s quirky, global, and older than many European kingdoms. Grab a *stroopwafel* and read on—here are nine facts about Dutch that even many Dutchies don’t know.\n\n---\n\n1. It’s Closer to English Than You Think  \nOld English and Old Dutch were basically linguistic cousins hanging out in the same North-Sea pub. Words like “appel” (apple), “maand” (month), and “glas” (glass) are near-identical, and both languages share the same Germanic DNA. *In other words, if you struggle with French verbs, Dutch might be your comfort blanket on the polyglot journey.*\n\n---\n\n2. The Longest Word Is 49 Letters—And You Can Eat It  \nKindercarnavalsoptochtvoorbereidingswerkzaamhedencomitéleden  \nTranslation: “members of the committee responsible for the preparation activities of a children’s carnival parade.” Theoretically you could keep tacking on nouns forever, but this tongue-twister holds the official record… for now.\n\n---\n\n3. Dutch Gave New York Its First Vocabulary  \nBefore Broadway and bagels, there was *Breukelen* (Brooklyn), *Haarlem* (Harlem), and *Bouwery* (Bowery). Even the word “cookie” comes from Dutch *koekje*. If you’ve ever gone skating on *waffles*—I mean, *wafers*—you’re tasting etymology.\n\n---\n\n4. It’s Spoken on Four Continents  \nDutch is an official language in the Netherlands, Belgium, Suriname, Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten. That’s Europe, South America, and the Caribbean—plus an energetic diaspora in Canada, Australia, and South Africa (hello, Afrikaans!). *\n\n---\n\n5. The “G” Is a Personality Test  \nTry saying *gracht* (canal) or *gaan* (to go). That back-of-the-throat rasp, technically a voiced velar fricative, is the linguistic equivalent of hot sauce: some people acquire a taste, others sprint back to Spanish rolled *rr*’s. Fun party trick: ask a Dutch person to pronounce *Scheveningen* and watch them smile knowingly—it was once a shibboleth that unmasked German spies in WWII.\n\n---\n\n6. Verbs Can Hide at the End  \nDutch sentences love to keep you in suspense. In subordinate clauses the verb packs its bags and trudges to the finale:  \nIk denk dat hij morgen komt.  \n(literally: “I think that he tomorrow comes.”) *This Yoda-like structure is a gentle reminder never to interrupt a Dutch story—wait for the verb or you’ll miss the punch-line.*\n\n---\n\n7. Diminutives Are Endless  \nAdd *-je* to almost any noun and it shrinks:  \n*huis* → *huisje* (little house)  \n*biertje* (little beer, i.e. a casual pint)  \nEven people aren’t safe—*lieverdje* is “sweetie-pie,” and *jong* becomes *jongetje* (little lad). The Dutch use these suffixes the way Italians use gestures: constantly and with affection.\n\n---\n\n8. Dutch Has a Word for “Skinny-Dipping in December”  \nMeet *winterzwemmen*: jumping into freezing canals for the bragging rights. If that isn’t vivid enough, how about *voorpret*—the joy you feel before the party even starts? The lexicon is basically a catalogue of cozy anticipation and mild masochism.\n\n---\n\n9. It’s the Easiest Language for Native English Speakers—According to the U.S. Foreign Service Institute  \nFSI clocked Dutch at just 24–30 weeks to reach general proficiency, fewer classroom hours than Spanish. *So if you’re looking for quick linguistic wins, Dutch is your low-hanging *appeltje*.*\n\n---\n\nReady to give it a go? Open any Dutch song on Spotify, follow the lyrics, and within minutes you’ll spot familiar roots wrapped in a charmingly guttural accent.

Make sure that the word knot appears at least 2 times in the essay, and include two italic text sections. Like: *this is italic text*", "response": "Wilderness preservation is not a sentimental hobby; it is an act of planetary humility. Long before we invented the wheel, the knot of life was tied in untamed valleys, on wind-scoured ridges, and in the hush of old-growth forests where no ax had ever echoed. To keep even a fraction of that knot intact is to admit that our ledger of knowledge is still badly out of balance. Yet every year more roads push farther, more pipelines snake underground, and more species quietly blink out as if they were never there. The question is no longer whether we can afford to protect wilderness, but whether we can survive the psychic and ecological bankruptcy of letting it vanish.\n\n*A single vanished songbird leaves a hole in the air that no device can measure.* The same is true of wolves, wild asters, glacial streams, and the invisible fungi beneath our boots. Remove one strand and the entire knot tightens differently; remove enough strands and the knot becomes a tangle that will not hold the weight of future generations. Wilderness areas, therefore, are not vacation backdrops—they are living libraries where evolution continues to write in languages older than grammar. When we bulldoze or fragment them, we burn pages that no polymath can reconstruct.\n\nOpponents of preservation often claim that locked-up land stifles economic growth. This is a coarse calculus that mistakes short-term revenue for enduring wealth. A stand of virgin cedar may fetch a one-time timber price, but left standing it filters water, anchors soil, draws tourists, and seeds entire forests for centuries. The knot of services performed by an intact ecosystem—carbon sequestration, flood buffering, pollination, spiritual renewal—outvalues any quarterly dividend. To pretend otherwise is like selling the keel of a ship for firewood while still planning to sail.\n\nThe political fight for wilderness is tangled in its own knot of red tape, mining leases, and grandfathered ranching permits. Yet progress comes when disparate voices braid together: Indigenous leaders who never ceded their spiritual geography, backcountry guides whose livelihood depends on grizzly scent and avalanche rose, urban students who discover self-worth during a first night beneath un-telescoped stars. *Their coalition is fragile, but it is also flexible, able to cinch tight when external pressure demands unity.* History shows that once an acre gains official designation, a strange alchemy occurs: the place itself becomes lobbyist, teacher, and healer, recruiting new defenders simply by existing.\n\nTechnology, too, can tighten the knot of protection instead of cutting it. Satellite collars track elk migrations so highway engineers know where to build underpasses; camera drones map invasive plants without a single boot print in critical calving grounds; open-source apps let hikers report illegal offload-vehicle scars before they widen. The key is to employ these tools as guests, not conquerors, remembering that telemetry can never replace the felt sensation of insignificance one experiences under a bowl of uncoordinated stars.\n\nFinally, wilderness preservation is an emotional endeavor. It asks us to love what we may never see, to defend silence we may never hear. I have stood in the Arctic Refuge where the only sound was my own heart, loud as a drum, and realized that this quiet was not empty but densely inhabited—by lichen, by lemmings, by the slow thoughts of sediments. Saving such places is less a charity than a form of self-respect: a declaration that the human story still contains chapters willing to cede authorship to wind, stone, and the patient knot of time.", "cost": 0.0014775, "instruction_id_list": ["keywords:frequency", "detectable_format:number_highlighted_sections"], "kwargs": [{"relation": "at least", "keyword": "knot", "frequency": 2}, {"num_highlights": 2}], "result": true}

Nothing here tells me why Cohen is different, safer, or better.\n\nSpecific issues  \n\n1. “Meet your new match!”  \n   Tap-out phrase. I haven’t even opened the app and I’m already being asked to commit to “my new match.” Feels presumptuous and hollow.\n\n2. “Cohen is a free app…”  \n   “Free” is table stakes; we assume dating apps are free to download. Use the precious first sentence to state a unique selling proposition, not a commodity feature.\n\n3. “…matches you with others based on your interests and location.”  \n   Literally what Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, OkCupid, Happn, etc. already do. If Cohen has a smarter algorithm (affinity clusters? real-time event matching? audio ice-breakers?) say so—explicitly.\n\n4. “find love, friendship, or just someone to swing with.”  \n   • “Love … friendship” is the standard textbook triad.  \n   • “Swing” is a loaded word. To most readers it implies partner-swapping/polyamory. If that’s not the intended niche, you’ve just alienated a big chunk of users. If it is the niche, own it unambiguously; otherwise replace with something like “grab coffee / catch a concert / hit the golf range.”\n\n5. Tone mismatch  \n   The name “Cohen” feels surname-serious; the copy tries to be playful and ends up flippant. Decide on a personality: witty, respectful, elite, queer-friendly, whatever—and stick to it.\n\n6. No social proof or safety cues  \n   Dating apps live or die on trust. You need at least a nod to verification, date-safe features, or community guidelines.\n\n7. Call-to-action is weak  \n   “Download Cohen today” = default CTA. Add urgency or reward: “Download today and your first week of Super-Cohen boosts is on us.”\n\n8. Length  \n   The entire blurb is 46 words—short enough for a billboard, but too vague to persuade. Add one concrete differentiator and drop the filler.\n\nRewrite sketch (for illustration, tighten tone and USP):  \n“Cohen learns the way you banter—our voice-note icebreakers match you on humor, not just zip codes. Verified profiles, zero bot games, and a 24-hr “cancel if it’s creepy” guarantee.
